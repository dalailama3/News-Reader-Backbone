But his ascendancy is no surprise to Rick Shenkman, author of a \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Political-Animals-Stone-Age-Brain-Politics/dp/0465033008?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003EPolitical Animals\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E published earlier this year, who writes on how human’s stone-age instincts are poorly suited to the modern political era.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese ancient instincts explain why so many are instinctively drawn to Trump, says Shenkman.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLess educated voters are particularly vulnerable to Trump’s demagoguery, he says, as they have no alternative source of knowledge to counter their biological instincts. “His base is low-information voters and he’s just coming right out and saying it: ‘\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/trump-i-love-the-poorly-educated-144008662.html\\\"\\u003EI love the poorly educated\\u003C/a\\u003E,’” he adds.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne of the strongest instincts is tribalism, says Shenkman, as we instinctively favor those with shared ancestry:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Donald Trump began his election in June, he’s been activating an ancient instinct in human brains, which is fear of the other. For many people, who lack other knowledge on which they can make their judgments about Mexican immigrants of Muslims coming into the United States, this winds up becoming a powerful trigger for their political beliefs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut Trump is only successful at activating these triggers because the modern political system tends to confuse our biological instincts. Our brains developed during the Pleistocene era, around 10,000 years ago, at a time when we were living in groups of 25 to 150 people. Humans lived and worked with their political leaders, and so could learn whether or not they trusted them first-hand. Today, the process is entirely artificial and we “get to know” politicians from TV appearances.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, the natural human tendency to lie has also muddied modern politics. “We all have the idea that human beings seek out and care about the truth,\\u0026#8221; Shenkman says. \\u0026#8220;But a key part of the evolution of human beings was the development of deception. We’re all cheaters at heart.” Humans have long had the ability to deceive and even our closest relative, chimpanzees, have \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=eHV_8YC_NL0C\\u0026amp;pg=PA247\\u0026amp;lpg=PA247\\u0026amp;dq=roger+fouts+lucy+deception\\u0026amp;source=bl\\u0026amp;ots=77x4ScfJjQ\\u0026amp;sig=ZeAUvKViuKzegHehX_tbyZGTTCg\\u0026amp;hl=en\\u0026amp;sa=X\\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI7K65mvDLAhXI6x4KHSqWDCUQ6AEIHDAA\\\"\\u003Ebeen found to lie\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince our brain is uncomfortable with dissonance, if we’re told a politician we instinctively like has lied, we’ll come up with excuses to dismiss the idea. We’re not so committed to the truth that we readily accept a challenge to our worldview.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“If you’re a Democrat and you catch a Republican lying, you’ll just be appalled,” Shenkman says. “But if you’re a Republican and a Republican gets caught in a lie, your partisan brain will kick into action, you’ll think up a million reasons why this person really didn’t lie.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat\\u0026#8217;s more, the distance between political figures and the electorate means we struggle to recognize deception. Humans\\u0026#8217; abilities to recognize lies developed at a time when we lived in far smaller groups in close proximity to each other, and such judgments simply don’t work as well when scrutinizing brief, distant, scripted media appearances.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf this sounds dpressing, Shenkman adds that we have the means, through culture and education, of countering our instincts. He points out that in May 1916, 15,000 gathered to watch Jesse Washington lynched in Waco, Texas. In the 100 years since, education has overridden our primordial fear of outsiders so that American mobs no longer delight in such cruelty. “We’re not slaves to our instincts,” says Shenkman. “We do have higher-order cognitive thinking.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch3\\u003ERead this next: \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/645345/inside-the-trump-machine-the-bizarre-psychology-of-americas-newest-political-movement/\\\"\\u003EInside the Trump machine: the bizarre psychology of America’s newest political movement\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/h3\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653524\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-02T12:05:47-04:00\",\"category\":\"2016\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653524\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rts68ht.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTS68HT\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rts68ht.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653524/trump-supporters-are-operating-on-biological-instinct/"], ["published_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:05:47 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Trump supporters are operating on biological instinct"], ["updated_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:07:04 UTC +00:00]]

Right now, the tiny quadcopter can skim into small spaces, perhaps to inspect a clogged pipe. But in the future, it might be able to do things such as assist in a hostage rescue.

Its origin story—a microbe isolated from the breast milk of a woman living far away from the corrupting influence of modernity—is touted as part of its appeal.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn many ways, Casas\\u0026#8217;s ideas were ahead of their time. Thirty years later, as research on the human microbiome has taken off, many microbiologists now make a similar argument. People in the developed world may have lost certain \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19898491/\\\"\\u003Eheirloom-like, mutualistic microbes\\u003C/a\\u003E, they say (including, it turns out, \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri\\u003C/em\\u003E, which does indeed \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063604/\\\"\\u003Eseem to be disappearing\\u003C/a\\u003E from westernized populations). Our health may be suffering as a consequence of these losses, contributing to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/among-trillions-of-microbes-in-the-gut-a-few-are-special/\\\"\\u003Erise in recent decades of asthma\\u003C/a\\u003E, autoimmune diseases, obesity, diabetes, and more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf we can restore the bugs that have disappeared, some argue, perhaps we can reverse the trend, treat, and even prevent these disorders. We in the developed world could “rewild” our bodies, goes the theory, with microbes derived from, say, Amerindian hunter-gatherers. Arguably, anyone who imbibes BioGaia’s \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri protectis\\u003C/em\\u003E is already doing a version of that.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe’re still a long way away from actually repopulating our bodies with “primeval” flora. Scientists are just beginning to catalog microbes from non-westernized groups and they still have no idea which are beneficial, which are harmful, or if such a transfer is even possible, let alone desirable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENevertheless, the microbiome field is making rapid progress in figuring out how to extract good bacteria from people and using them to treat various conditions. The shining success so far—the fecal transplant, which is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205037\\\"\\u003Eover 90% effective\\u003C/a\\u003E in vanquishing colitis, caused by the gut pathogen \\u003Cem\\u003EClostridium difficile\\u003C/em\\u003E—is essentially a crude form of microbial ecosystem restoration, in other words, the transplant of a healthy person’s microbiome to a diseased person.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECompanies like Seres Therapeutics and Vedanta Biosciences are working to develop more refined products—US government-approved therapies to treat obesity and inflammatory diseases, using microbes harvested from other healthy people in the developed world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUltimately, though, the only way to recover certain essential bugs lost to us in the developed world may be to acquire them from people who, like Dr. Casas’s Peruvian woman, still have them. And so, microbiologists are hurrying to study the microbes of peoples living more “traditional” lifestyles, including \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/3/e1500183\\\"\\u003EAmerindians in the Amazon\\u003C/a\\u003E, east African \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140415/ncomms4654/full/ncomms4654.html\\\"\\u003Ehunter-gatherers\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247%2815%2900340-X\\\"\\u003EPapuans\\u003C/a\\u003E, before their microbiomes modernize—before they urbanize, get flush toilets, take copious antibiotics, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/how-the-western-diet-has-derailed-our-evolution\\\"\\u003Etransition to a refined-food diet\\u003C/a\\u003E, and do all the other things thought to distort and deplete the human microbiota.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt this point, scientists are careful to characterize the research as purely descriptive. They’re only trying to understand what’s there, they say, and what it does. Yet the mere possibility of one day rewilding our bodies with microbes harvested from other people raises a fraught question: Who owns these microbes, and how should we compensate them for their use? Say that a microbial mix originally isolated from a Yanomami tribesman becomes a bestseller fix for asthma. Should the donor, or his tribe, receive a share of the profits? For that matter, did that Peruvian woman receive compensation? (Bo Möllstam, BioGaia’s technical director, says that the company is careful to comply with research ethics requirements of the countries it works in, and it did so in that case.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne line of thinking holds that because microbes are widespread and naturally occurring, they don’t belong to anyone. You can patent treatments and methods, or genetically modified organisms, but you can’t patent free-living organisms, even if those organisms are living on your body. Sure, donors can be compensated for time and effort—on average, the stool banking non-profit OpenBiome pays its donors up to $4,320 a year—but ultimately, it’s scientific know-how that transforms human feces into medicine.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The donors didn\\u0026#8217;t come up with the knowledge that allowed us to create an ecosystem,” says Emma Allen-Vercoe, a microbiologist at the University of Guelph in Canada. As it is, there’s already too much red tape slowing research, she says. The field doesn’t need more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere’s the wrinkle, though: Ivan Casas went to the Peruvian Andes precisely because he thought those populations had something Americans didn’t. Ditto with the scientists now studying peoples in the Amazon or East Africa. They suspect the microbiomes of these populations are unique and unlike our own—a suspicion that has so far proven correct. Amerindians in the Amazon harbor up 50% more microbial species than North Americans. They possess microbes we simply don’t.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMaria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, a microbiologist at New York University who studies remote Amerindian groups, feels strongly that, legal reasoning aside, there\\u0026#8217;s a \\u003Cem\\u003Emoral\\u003C/em\\u003E obligation to share the benefits of research with subjects. Compensation can raise other sticky issues, though. For instance, how do you pay an Amerindian hunter-gatherer who has no use for money? You might give them medicine and goods—they particularly like digital cameras, Dominguez-Bello says—or open a health clinic, but then you begin changing their way of life.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We spoil the very place we come to study,” she says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBioGaia’s Möllstam acknowledges these concerns as “something that needs to be dealt with in a serious way.” “We need to realize that we need to share whatever comes out of [research]”, he says. But modern gene sequencing technology may also make the issue moot. These days, when scientists understand how a healthful bacterium works, they can study its genome and find other microbes that behave the same way—something that was impossible in the past. BioGaia, which has a catalog of thousands of \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri\\u003C/em\\u003E strains, wouldn’t go to Peru today searching for lactobacilli, he says, because it wouldn’t need to.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“When you know what you’re looking for,” he says, “you can pick microbes up almost anywhere.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=637744\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-02T07:00:03-04:00\",\"category\":\"Life as Laboratory\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/637744\",\"dc_creator\":\"Moises Velasquez-Manoff\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/microbes_1600x900_02.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Microbes_1600x900_02\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/microbes_1600x900_02.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/637744/should-we-rewild-our-urban-bodies-with-microbes-from-indigenous-peoples/"], ["published_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 11:00:03 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Should we &#8220;rewild&#8221; our urban bodies with microbes from indigenous peoples?"], ["updated_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:07:04 UTC +00:00]]

First ,  if you want to see the size of the Indian internet economy, you must include chunks of Google, Facebook, Twitter and others in it,  because these are India’s leading internet companies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1249\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EThere are several ways to do it. One is to look at global revenues and market caps of these companies and attribute the Indian market cap to the share of Indian revenue in the global pie. I tried that, but came across a big issue: not knowing the Indian revenues of many of these firms, because it’s not separately called out.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"091d\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EI tried it a second way : to attribute the India-linked market cap to the Indian share of the firm’s global users, and that data was a little more accessible. I took all data from public sources such as press releases or estimates from SimilarWeb and the like. Wherever available, I took user or customer numbers (in regular font below), and where it was not available, I’ve taken traffic numbers (in italics below). And instead of private company valuations that would count Uber and such — I’ve taken more conservative public company valuations.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EOh, and further, all mistakes are mine alone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"4327\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EHere’s what I came up with.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-653427\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/table.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/table.jpg?quality=80\\u0026strip=all\\u0026w=800\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-camera\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(Mahesh Murthy)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"5d97\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\u003EThe top 10 global internet companies have a combined market cap of over $1.3 trillion. But one can attribute up to $150 billion to Indian users.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"07cd\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EYes, of course, there is a large caveat here. First that, as said before, the Indian share of global revenues will give a more accurate picture. And our share of revenues will certainly be less than our share of traffic or users. So, you can discount this number by 25%, 50% or even 75% to adjust for that — but the final number is still significant. Though I do think market caps are not just a function of revenues . User base is also a prime consideration — after all that’s where the growth will come from.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"2f03\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ENow if you add the $30 billion or so of market cap of our local unicorns to this $150 billion, we’ll end up with around $180 billion of market cap for our current internet economy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"dbbd\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EThen, adjust for the fact that China has 720 million internet users and India has exactly half, 360 million users. $520 billion of Chinese market cap per head across 720 million users is $722 per user. Our number turns out to $180 billion of market cap across 360 million users — or $500 per user.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"dba4\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo the real difference between the Chinese internet potential and Indian internet potential is not 10x or 15x — but perhaps closer to 40% or 1.4x. Or you can be pessimistic and call it 2x if you like. But 10x it isn’t.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"8e40\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EWhat are the takeaways here?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"4b27\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EFirst that there just isn’t as much headroom for growth in the broad internet economy for startups in India as you’ve been told there is. The $180 billion may grow over a few years to $300 billion . But between $200 billion and $250 billion of that will accrue to non-Indian firms, leaving between $50 and $100 billion for Indian startups. Please adjust your expectations accordingly.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1bd0\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo, a more apt way of looking at the Indian potential is to see us like the 51st state of the US. Or like a UK. Large market for global companies — not necessarily a large market for local firms.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"7e7f\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EI’d say much of the growth assumed for our current unicorns is probably vastly over-estimated. Especially if the Indian unicorn has global competition in its way.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"ca17\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESecond, the nature of internet businesses is largely a winner-take-all in any niche. If you see the market share that Google ended up with in search, Gmail in email, Facebook in social networking, Twitter in microblogging, YouTube in video etc , they’re all well above 80%. So if you take on a niche , you either end up the leader with 80% of it, or a distant no. 2 with 8% of it or a non-player with 0.8% of it. This is where the chips largely tend to fall, though there are a few exceptions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"5976\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo, your likely playbook if you take on a global internet company are (a) to be bought by the global player or (b) to end up eventually as the 8% play.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1b3c\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo what’s going to happen to Flipkart now that Amazon and Alibaba have declined to buy it? Or to Ola now that Uber has declined to buy it? It may not be the nicest of news, I believe.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"751d\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EWhich leads us to the third take-away. If you want to build a large internet business in India , then do it out of the way of the globals. Build something where the globals aren’t. From my own portfolio, I’d suggest that RedBus, CarWale, MyDentist, Chumbak and others have picked the right areas. Other firms such as InMobi, Naukri and Paytm, too, are on paths outside the globals’ footprints. This is a good place to be over the long term , unless you’re sure you can sell out to a global like Baazee did to eBay. I personally believe this is extremely risky as the global firm may just turn around and say “nope, I’ll build it myself”, as many are increasingly doing so.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"229b\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EAnd the fourth takeaway is for these firms to go global too. Naukri has expanded to West Asia. Chumbak is in Japan. InMobi is all over. And we’ll do better to expand to 2nd and 3rd world countries than taking on the first world.

AbstractController::DoubleRenderError - Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".:

While in Virginia, he visits friends and takes daily walks, in an effort to integrate himself with the community.

He adds:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The likelihood of danger is remote in the extreme. This is an easy one in some respects. Yet the political fallout of the crime is so great that these experiments in freedom, which the court has continued to allow, have been very incremental and slow.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA shocking verdict\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince the shooting, Hinckley’s experiences in court have not gone according to expectations. At the time of his trial, Alan Stone, professor of law and psychiatry at Harvard Law School, went on national television to predict, “There was no chance he’d be found not guilty by reason of insanity.” Typically, the insanity defense is only successful when the prosecution agrees to it—not when it’s contested. Valerie Hans, law professor at Cornell Law School, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/334/\\\"\\u003Econducted a study\\u003C/a\\u003E on the public’s reaction post-verdict, and says that many were furious that attacking the US leader had seemingly gone unpunished.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“There was a sense among the public that this was the wrong outcome, even if the details were lost on them,” she says. Many seemed to think the insanity defense was “quite literally getting away with murder.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA shift in the law\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough it was difficult to successfully plead not guilty by reason of insanity in 1981, it became even more challenging \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Henry-Steadman-PhD-Evaluating-1993-06-05/dp/B014BH92RE?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003Esince Hinckley’s trial\\u003C/a\\u003E. In particular, the burden of proof shifted, so that instead of the prosecution having to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane, it became the role of the defense to prove that the defendant was criminally insane. This marked a major turning point in US insanity defense law, says Hans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We had been moving in a direction towards greater accommodation of people with mental illness and there were expansive insanity defense laws,” she says. “After his verdict, the federal government and the state government wound up modifying and restricting further what could happen.” In Delaware, for example the state \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://law.justia.com/cases/delaware/supreme-court/1988/538-a-2d-1104-4.html\\\"\\u003Emodified the not guilty by reason of insanity defense\\u003C/a\\u003E within days of the Hinckley verdict, creating the option of “guilty but mentally ill.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s possible that this shift in the burden of proof would have made a dramatic difference to Hinckley’s verdict. Stephen J Morse, professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, says that while he read the trial transcripts he did not attend the trial, and so his opinions are purely speculative, he believes that Hinckley could have lost if he’d been tried in a local rather than federal jurisdiction. In a local jurisdiction at the time, Hinckley’s defense attorneys would have had to show on “a preponderance of the evidence” (i.e. more likely than not) that he was criminally insane—a markedly different burden from the prosecution having to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe system working at its best\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut while the verdict could have so easily gone another way, Hinckley was found not guilty. And, in the years since, has received strong psychiatric support.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStone says that, compared to many other mentally ill criminals in the US who are possible contenders for the insanity defense, Hinckley has received excellent treatment and supervision.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“I think the system rarely works this way but this time, with all the special attention, it worked very well,” he says. “I think it’s amazing that somebody who killed people, maimed people, shot the president of the United States, was able to be restored to sanity, and allowed to leave the hospital, if only partially.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnfortunately, this is not the case for many others. The system of public care for the mentally ill in the US is “in terrible shape,” says Stone, and that there’s little hope of replicating Hinckley’s treatment. “We don’t have the resources, in this wealthy country, to treat anybody else the way we treated Hinckley,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA return to sanity\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFollowing the help he’s received, psychiatric evaluations suggest that Hinckley is no longer suffering from the mental illnesses he experienced 35 years ago. Levine says that others with mental illness who commit criminal acts deserve the same rehabilitation process.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnlike physical health, where it’s widely understood that it’s possible to recover from a broken arm or heart attack, Levine says that many seems to believe a mental disability never fades.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“They think that if you have that, you’re condemned to suffer from it forever, and because you’ve committed a grievous criminal act, it’s likely you’ll do that again,” he says. “That’s just wrong, but that’s the common perception, and that’s why there are so few people who get the benefits that John had.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStone says that he and most other psychiatrists view serious mental illnesses as more akin to diabetes—something that should be treated for life, but can be managed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“If the patient has insight into the fact that they have a mental illness, are willing to take their medications, and work with doctors, then it can be controlled the same way that diabetes can,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough only a psychiatric professional can give a confident assessment of Hinckley’s health, court documents and his time away from hospital suggest that he’s no longer a danger to the public.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMorse, who is not involved in the case, speculates that, were Hinckley an ordinary citizen rather than the man who shot President Reagan, he “might very well have been released before now.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPolitics has undoubtedly shaped this high-profile case, and the judge has been cautious in gradually allowing Hinckley greater freedom. But perhaps, Morse suggests, there will be less pressure to keep Hinckley confined following Nancy Reagan’s death.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, in a country with typically onerous prison sentences, it might seem strange that a man can shoot the president and walk free. But, as Hinckley was found not guilty, Morse points out that he cannot be legally punished.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The judge or public may believe this person should not have been acquitted by reason of insanity, and so they may feel this person should be kept longer,” he says. “But that’s not an adequate justification under law. My concern, both legally and in terms of his mental health, is whether he needed to be hospitalized for as long as he has been.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653671\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T11:11:29-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653671\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/reagan_assassination_attempt_3.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Reagan_assassination_attempt_3\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/reagan_assassination_attempt_3.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653671/35-years-later-the-man-who-shot-president-reagan-is-close-to-being-free/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 15:11:29 UTC +00:00], ["title", "35 years later, the man who shot President Reagan is close to being free"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]

But plenty of other machines are involved in work that has clear ethical implications.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWendell Wallach, a scholar at Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and author of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Master-Technology-Slipping-Control/dp/0465058620?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003E“A Dangerous Master\\u003C/a\\u003E: How to keep technology from slipping beyond our control,” points out that in hospitals, APACHE medical systems help determine the best treatments for patients in intensive care units—often those who are at the edge of death. Wallach points out that, though the doctor may seem to have autonomy, it could be very difficult in certain situations to go against he machine—particularly in a litigious society. “Is the doctor really free to make an independent decision?,” he says. “You might have a situation where the machine is the de facto decision-maker.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs robots become more advanced, their ethical decision-making will only become more sophisticated. But this raises the question of how to program ethics into robots, and whether we can trust machines with moral decisions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow to build an ethical machine\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBroadly speaking, there are two main approaches to creating an ethical robot. The first is to decide on a specific ethical law (maximize happiness, for example), write a code for such a law, and create a robot that strictly follows the code. But the difficulty here is deciding on the appropriate ethical rule. Every moral law, even the seemingly simple one above, has a myriad of exceptions and counter examples. For example, should a robot maximize happiness by harvesting the organs from one man to save five?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The issues of morality in general are very vague,” says Ronald Arkin, professor and director of the mobile robot laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology. “We still argue as human beings about the correct moral framework we should use, whether it’s a consequentialist utilitarian means-justify-the-ends approach, or a Kantian deontological rights-based approach.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd this isn’t simply a matter of arguing until we figure out the right answer. Patrick Lin, director of Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, says ethics may not be internally consistent, which would make it impossible to reduce to programs. “The whole system may crash when it encounters paradoxes or unresolvable conflicts,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe second option is to create a machine-learning robot and teach it how to respond to various situations so as to arrive at an ethical outcome. This is similar to how humans learn morality, though it raises the question of whether humans are, in fact, the best moral teachers. If humans like those who interacted with Tay teach a machine-learning robot, then it won’t develop particularly ethical sensibilities.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn some ways, Tay’s ability to absorb what it was being taught is impressive, says Arkin. But he says the bot was “abused by people.” He adds:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou can do that to a simpleton too. In many ways AIs are really simpletons. You can make a fool of somebody, and they choose to make a fool of the AI agent.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EPutting theories into action\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHow to create ethical robots isn’t simply an abstract theory; several philosophers and computer scientists are currently working on just such a feat.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGeorgia Institute of Technology\\u0026#8217;s Arkin is working on trying to make machines comply with international humanitarian law. In this case, there’s a huge body of laws and instructions for machines to follow, which have been developed by humans and agreed by international states. Though some cases are less clear than others, Arkin believes his project will be complete in the next couple of decades.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis work relies a great deal on top-down coding and less so on machine learning—after all, you wouldn’t want to send someone into a military situation and leave them to figure out how to respond.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, Susan Anderson, a philosophy professor at the University of Connecticut, is working with her husband Michael Anderson, a computer science professor at the University of Hartford, to develop robots that can provide ethical care for the elderly. The Andersons’ approach relies far more on machine learning—but, instead of learning from the general public, the machines interact only with ethicists.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESusan Anderson says their work was influenced by philosophers John Rawls and W. D. Ross. While Rawls’ writing on “reflected equilibrium” says that moral principles can be extracted from the ethical decisions made in particular scenarios, Ross makes the case that humans have several prima facie moral duties. We have an obligation to each of these prima facie duties; however, none of them are absolute or automatically override the others. So, in cases where they conflict, they have to be balanced and weighed against each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Andersons work with machine-learning robots to develop principles for elder healthcare. In one case, they created an intelligent system to decide on the ethical course of action when a patient had refused the advised treatment from a healthcare worker. Should the healthcare worker try and convince the patient to accept treatment or not? This involves many complicated ethical duties, including respect for the autonomy of the patient, possible harm to the patient, and possible benefit to the patient.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnderson found that once the robot had been taught a moral response to four specific scenarios, it was then able to generalize and make an appropriate ethical decision in the remaining 14 cases. From this, she was \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://franz.com/success/customer_apps/artificial_intelligence/EthEl/robot-be-good.PDF\\\"\\u003Eable to derive the ethical principle\\u003C/a\\u003E:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“That you should attempt to convince the patient if either the patient is likely to be harmed by not taking the advised treatment or the patient would lose \\u003Cem\\u003Econsiderable\\u003C/em\\u003E benefit. Not just a little benefit, but considerable benefit by not taking the recommended treatment.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough in that early work, the robot was first coded with simple moral duties—such as the importance of preventing harm—the Andersons have since done work where no ethical slant was assumed. Instead, the intelligent system learnt even these moral principles from interacting with ethicists.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EShould we trust robots with morality?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s clearly possible to create robots with some ethical abilities—but should we be pursuing such work? Anderson points out that in some ways, robots can be superior ethical decision-makers to humans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Humans are a product of natural selection so we have built into us ideas that are self-interested or at least in the interest of our group over others. These are a result of being able to survive as a species,” she says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHumans are also prone to making mistakes, and are not perfect arbiters of justice.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat said, it’s unlikely robots will be able to address the most sophisticated ethical decisions for the foreseeable future. And certainly, while we’re still confused about certain moral sensibilities among humans, it would be unwise to hand the reigns over to robots. As Arkin points out, “Human moral reasoning is not well understood. Nor, in general, is it fully agreed upon.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnderson and the other professors I spoke to agree that machines should not function in areas where there’s moral controversy. And Lin adds that he questions whether it’s ethical, on principle, to offload the hard work of ethical decisions onto machines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“How can a person grow as a person or develop character without using their moral muscle?,” he says. “Imagine if we had an exoskeleton that could make us move, run, life, and do all other physical things better.  Would our lives really be better off if we outsourced physical activity to machines, instead of exercising our own muscles?”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EImproving morality through robots\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut though we may not want to leave the most advanced ethical decisions to machines just yet, work on robotic ethics is advancing our own understanding for morality.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWallach points out that in his book “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Machines-Teaching-Robots-Right/dp/0199737975?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003EMoral Machines\\u003C/a\\u003E: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong,” he argued that just as computers advanced the philosophical understanding of the mind, the same will become true for robots and the study of ethics. The Andersons developing a principle based on their healthcare intelligent system is just one example. Anderson points out that the history of ethics shows a steadily building consensus—and work on robot ethics can contribute to refining moral reasoning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERobot ethics also highlights the elements of ethical decision-making \\u003Cem\\u003Easide\\u003C/em\\u003E from reasoning, says Wallach, such as moral emotions or knowledge of social norms. \\u0026#8220;Because we were talking about whether robots could morally reason, it forced us to look at capabilities humans have that we take for granted and what role they may have in making ethical decisions,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt might simply be impossible to reduce human ethical decision making into numerical values for robots to understand, says Lin—how do we codify compassion or mercy, for example. But he says that robot ethics can be seen as a problem of human ethics. \\u0026#8220;Thinking about how robots ought to behave is a soul searching exercise in how humans ought to behave,” he says. “It’s a way for us to know ourselves.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653575\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T09:00:23-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653575\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtr3gc9i.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTR3GC9I\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtr3gc9i.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653575/can-we-trust-robots-to-make-moral-decisions/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:00:23 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Can we trust robots to make moral decisions?"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]

Instead my fantasies revolved around bylines and books. As I got older, I dedicated much of my energy to getting my writing career off the ground—waking up at 5 am to write fiction before turning to my paying work, and sending submissions to literary journals. My husband and I talked about having a child one day, but in the meantime I concentrated on my career. I didn’t yearn for a baby. I yearned for a book deal, an artist’s retreat, a plum writing gig.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, it’s perfectly possible to be both a mother and a writer. But once women give birth, they’re expected to identify as mothers first and foremost. We’re pressured to move whatever we were before—artist, executive, scientist, ski bum—to the backseat. And so motherhood completely razed the landscape of my identity when I gave birth to my son at age 33.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EParenting in isolation\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“When I see pregnant women, I want to take them by their shoulders and shake.

I knew that raising a baby wouldn’t be easy, but I was unprepared for the overwhelming physical realities of providing constant care for an infant. There is no way to understand the effects of sleep deprivation until you’ve personally spent weeks on end sleeping in three-hour fits. I staggered through the day unshowered, surviving on handfuls of dry cereal. I put off work, sex, and personal hygiene. Suddenly it was clear to me why so many women defined themselves as mothers first. I literally had no time for anything else.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETo make matters worse, our family had recently moved to a new town, two hours away from our deeply-rooted community. Isolation took its toll. My husband was wonderful and supportive, but he worked full-time. I wanted a circle of wise women, elders full of love and patience who could help get me through this without screwing everything up and losing my sanity. But I spent much of those early days with no one but my infant to talk to, the two of us crying in tandem.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENormally I would have turned to writing to process my thoughts and emotions, but now I had no time for it.

I felt redeemed—both in my own eyes and in the eyes of the world. Seeing my name in print offered proof that I wasn’t “just” a mother. That’s a terribly sad statement about how much American culture values motherhood. But let’s face it: many people don’t see parenting as “real” work, and I had firmly internalized that message.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd yet even as our culture dismisses the labor of parenthood, it enforces a deep ambivalence about mothers who dare to pursue careers. A 2013 study by the Pew Research Center shows that Americans are conflicted \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/institutions/Modern%20Parenthood%20%7C%20Pew%20Social%20\\u0026amp;%20Demographic%20Trends.pdf\\\"\\u003Eabout the idea of mothers even returning to work.\\u003C/a\\u003E “Among all adults, only 16% say the ideal situation for a young child is to have a mother who works full time,” the report notes. And so I was convinced that I was horribly selfish for being dedicated to my writing career, yet equally petrified that people would see me only as my son’s mother—never again as a person with hopes and desires of her own.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat finally changed my outlook turned out to be surprisingly simple. At long last, I made friends with other mothers. Together we formed not so much a village as a wailing wall.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EI was convinced that I was selfish for being dedicated to my career, yet petrified that people would see me only as my son’s mother.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003ENow I had women to whom I could admit that I sometimes sort of hated my child—at least when he was throwing a tantrum in the middle of the grocery store. I could sit in their kitchens, half-dead with exhaustion, as they made tea. I could show up at their doors with a cranky toddler and count on being welcomed in and fed. They didn’t judge me for having unkempt hair or wearing my sweater inside out. And many of these mothers had also held strong professional identities before they had children. They were firefighters, lawyers, and teachers, and they were also struggling to figure out how to have a career that was somehow compatible with child-rearing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We get thrown a lot of ‘do and be whatever you want and lean in,’” Albert tells Quartz, referring to her own experiences with motherhood. “But the realities of childbearing are not compatible with that.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI finally understood that almost all mothers struggle to find the right balance between family and career once I had this circle of friends. And I also had a bigger epiphany: We aren’t meant to parent in isolation.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EA circle of women\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMost of us aren’t going to rush out and form communes anytime soon. But it’s undoubtedly true that mothers need to seen, heard, and helped by others who have had the same experiences and know what it’s like to be in the trenches. Once I found my community, I found that the energy I’d spent obsessing over parenting and self-loathing was suddenly freed up. Only then was I truly able to feel like myself again.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPsychologists have reached the same conclusions. “In terms of perinatal mood disorders, social support is one of the legs that holds a mom up,” Katayune Kaeni, a California-based maternal mental health specialist and psychologist tells Quartz. “Just not feeling alone helps.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“For the women I see, to feel that ‘I’m not crazy, this is a thing and it happens, that’s incredibly relieving,” Kaeni continues.

In the rawness of literature, women tell the unvarnished, necessary truths about raising children. “Women have always been the storytellers.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, I count novels like Albert’s, and memoirs like Rachel Cusk’s \\u003Cem\\u003EA Life’s Work\\u003C/em\\u003E, among my circle of women. My friends have helped to ground me so that I can tackle both writing and mothering. In the same way, stories of rough entrées into motherhood offer me companionship. What\\u0026#8217;s more, books that tell women’s messy, emotionally complex stories remind me of why I write in the first place.

The majority of shortages tend to be critical care drugs, cancer medications, and antibiotics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ENationwide, shortages of critical drugs are not particularly new or rare. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EEfforts like a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gphaonline.org/issues/drug-shortages\\\"\\u003E“Drug Shortage Summit”\\u003C/a\\u003E held by physician and pharmacist groups in November of 2010 may have helped in the short-term, but they failed to attack the root of the problem. And while the FDA says shortages have declined, the picture painted by other organizations are less rosy. According to the University of Utah’s Drug Information Service, for example, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-drug-shortages-frustrate-doctors-patients-1433125793\\\"\\u003Ein May of 2015 there were around 250 drugs\\u003C/a\\u003E in short supply across the US.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, on any given day you can go to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists website and check out its \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ashp.org/drugshortages/current/\\\"\\u003Ecurrent list of shortages\\u003C/a\\u003E. The website proclaims proudly that they “work to keep the public informed of the most current drug shortages.” But is awareness enough? As of March, I counted 153 medications on the APH list, ranging from antibiotics to vaccines, cardiac medications, and cancer drugs. Even saline, a simple mix of salt and water used for hydration and resuscitation, made the list. In 2014, similar shortages of saline\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/06/22/323679204/shortage-of-saline-solution-has-hospitals-on-edge\\\"\\u003E forced hospitals to develop special protocols\\u003C/a\\u003E designed to conserve IV fluids.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo how is it that one of the richest nations in the world could possibly have a shortage of salt water—or any of these generic drugs?

In order to create a sort of emergency pipeline, the generic pharmaceutical industry has started what it calls the “Accelerated Recovery Initiative (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gphaonline.org/issues/drug-shortages\\\"\\u003EARI\\u003C/a\\u003E),” the goal of which is to limit the number of patients who cannot get a hold of drugs in critical shortage. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.policymed.com/2012/09/ftc-approves-accelerated-recovery-initiative-to-reduce-drug-shortages.html\\\"\\u003EWhile the process is long\\u003C/a\\u003E and complicated, it proves this is not an entirely unsolvable issue.

Among its provisions, the bill would provide expedited review of new generic drug applications “only if there’s one competing generic on the market or if the generic is on FDA’s drug shortage list.” Collins’ actions represent yet another step forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEnding the generic shortage will not be easy, but then again, neither is curing cancer. If we can embark on a moonshot to find novel therapies that will cost thousands of dollars a dose, why can’t we find ways to ensure that the generic drugs we’ve been making for pennies a vial can actually make it to the hands of our patients? We need to permanently fix this problem rather than putting on another bandaid—we never seem to have a shortage of those.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653136\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T07:30:46-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653136\",\"dc_creator\":\"Dr. Anees Chagpar\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ap763297742944.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Cancer Chemotherapy\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ap763297742944.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653136/americas-ongoing-lack-of-generic-drugs-is-a-matter-of-life-and-death/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 11:30:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "America&#8217;s ongoing lack of generic drugs is a matter of life and death"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]

Not surprisingly, prime minister Narendra Modi and his government have been serious about cultivating ties with trips to the region. Eight months after a visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Modi once again headed to the region, this time to Saudi Arabia to strengthen Delhi\\u0026#8217;s close relations with the kingdom and loosen the Saudi-Pakistani ties in the process.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndia is a major trade partner in the region, and Modi aims to position India globally so as to isolate Pakistan\\u0026#8217;s military-industrial complex and its policy of using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. The Saudis hope to leverage Indian expertise in IT and services to modernise and diversify a single-source economy dependent on oil.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndia\\u0026#8217;s ties with Saudi Arabia have grown over the last two decades based on burgeoning energy ties and the Indian diaspora—the largest group of foreign workers in the Saudi kingdom. Modi has already met King Salman of Saudi Arabia a few times, and Saudi help was critical in the evacuation of Indian nationals from the Yemeni war zone. The 2012 deportation of Sayed Zabiuddin, also known as Abu Jundal, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, signaled a sea change in Saudi Arabia\\u0026#8217;s counterterrorism priorities.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESaudi Arabia is cautious in balancing ties between Pakistan and India. Ahead of Modi\\u0026#8217;s visit, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir tried to alleviate concerns in Pakistan about budding Indo-Saudi ties and insisted that Saudi Arabia\\u0026#8217;s \\u0026#8220;relations with Pakistan do not come at the expense of [its] relations with India.\\u0026#8221; Adel al-Jubeir and Mohammad bin Salman, deputy crown prince and defense minister, visited Pakistan in January despite growing anger at Islamabad\\u0026#8217;s refusal to commit troops in Yemen and join the Saudi-led \\u0026#8220;coalition against terrorism\\u0026#8221; of 34 Islamic nations.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe once close Saudi-Pakistani relationship, with the Saudis even bankrolling the Pakistani nuclear programme, has hit a troubled patch.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPakistan was the target during Modi\\u0026#8217;s 2015 visit to the UAE, the first by an Indian prime minister to the country in 34 years. A joint statement issued by Modi and UAE\\u0026#8217;s crown prince Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan managed to redefine the contours of a relationship that had long been bereft of political heft. Both sides denounced terrorism in \\u0026#8220;all forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by whomever, calling on all states to reject and abandon the use of terrorism against other countries, dismantle terrorism infrastructures where they exist, and bring perpetrators of terrorism to justice.\\u0026#8221; The UAE is among the countries closest to Pakistan, and the message, endorsing India\\u0026#8217;s concerns on terrorism and underscoring the challenges facing gulf kingdoms amid a widening sectarian divide, was a diplomatic triumph for Modi, demonstrating foresight on changing strategic realities in the Middle East.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor Indian strategists, any ally that can act as a counterweight to Pakistan in the Islamic world is useful. Saudi Arabia does the same with Iran, the two nations long competing for power and influence in the Gulf. As the regional balance of power between the two threatens to unravel in Iran\\u0026#8217;s favour, India has repeatedly emphasized a desire for stabilisation in the region\\u0026#8217;s extant balance of power.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-653779\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tradepartners-700px.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tradepartners-700px.jpg?quality=80\\u0026strip=all\\u0026w=700\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Jockeying: India is a valued trade partner considered it ranks ninth in GDP worldwide, followed by Saudi Arabia at 19th; Iran, 29th, UAE, 31rd; and Pakistan, 43rd (Data: CIA World Factbook on exports and imports)\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-camera\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003EJockeying: India is a valued trade partner considered it ranks ninth in GDP worldwide, followed by Saudi Arabia at 19th; Iran, 29th, UAE, 31rd; and Pakistan, 43rd (Data: CIA World Factbook on exports and imports)\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENew Delhi had long tried to cultivate Tehran, but efforts stumbled as the Islamic Republic adopted an increasingly aggressive anti-western posture. India had hoped Saudi Arabia might fill that gap as Iranian nuclear ambitions helped draw New Delhi and Riyadh closer together. Riyadh agreed to double oil exports to India, helping New Delhi reduce its reliance on Iran. Today, Saudi Arabia is the largest supplier of crude oil to India and India\\u0026#8217;s fourth largest trading partner. At a time when Riyadh has been losing its market share in countries such as China and the US, it supplanted Iraq as the top supplier of crude oil to India. The huge Indian diaspora in the country, nearly three million, makes India the largest recipient of foreign remittances from the kingdom at an estimated $11 billion. Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia each send about 1.5 million foreign workers to Saudi Arabia.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndian IT companies are building capacity in Saudi Arabia, including an all-women business process operations center run by TCS as one example.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndia\\u0026#8217;s balancing involves developing closer ties with other key regional players, enhancing engagement on more substantive terms.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWith the US opening to Iran, a new phase begins in Indo-Iranian ties. Easing of western sanctions on Iran opens the country for a more normal relationship with India, including more energy trade and greater participation of the Indian corporate sector. India has also approved a provision of $150 million to Iran for the development of the vital port of Chabahar, allowing India to compete with China\\u0026#8217;s development of Gwadar port in Pakistan and have an opening to Central Asia. And, no top Indian leader had visited Israel until president Pranab Mukherjee\\u0026#8217;s visit in 2015—that despite 24 years of diplomatic ties and working closely on defense, counterterrorism, agriculture and energy-related issues. Previous Indian governments were reticent in acknowledging partnership with Israel, largely for fear of offending domestic Muslim sentiments.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EModi\\u0026#8217;s visit to Saudi Arabia underscores India\\u0026#8217;s stakes in a region with multiple fault lines and its preference for a stable balance of power.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere are calls in India for Modi to take a more active role encouraging bridges between Riyadh and Tehran, but New Delhi is probably not ready to don the mantle of a regional reconciler, especially when other major powers are taking a cautious approach. The Obama administration, no longer dependent on Saudi oil, is openly critical of Saudi policies and, after opening to Iran, signals that the US retains other options. As Washington prunes its role as a guarantor of regional security, China is trying to raise its regional profile. President Xi Jinping visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran earlier this year to promote its One Belt, One Road Initiative and establish credentials as a reliable regional economic and political partner even as it continues to avoid defense security responsibilities.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInvestments in the region carry high risk.

For the best part of two years Zuma resisted accepting the “remedial action”. The Constitutional Court this week ruled that this remedial action was binding on him. He also used his party’s majority in the National Assembly to further filibuster and obfuscate – earning the national parliament a similarly sharp rebuke from the Constitutional Court.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EANC\\u0026#8217;s secretary general stated, several times, that the party does not “pivot” around any one leader.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn another, earlier case involving a challenge to the Public Protector’s powers by the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s chief 0perating officer Hlaudi Motsoneng, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Madonsela’s powers were not binding like a court order. But, the court found, any “remedial action” that she ordered should be taken by the government unless there was a rational reason not to.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen the decision was appealed, the Supreme Court of Appeal later \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2015/10/09/court-judgment-affirms-reach-of-madonselas-powers\\\"\\u003Eadjusted\\u003C/a\\u003E this legal test to the one that the Constitutional Court confirmed on Thursday—namely that the power of the Public Protector to “take remedial action” is binding unless successfully challenged by way of judicial review.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EZuma and his lawyers are adept at using the courts as a delaying tactic. The challenge to the decision to drop corruption charges against him shortly before he came to power in 2009 has dragged along at a snail’s pace thanks to his various procedural challenges. A decision of the North Gauteng High Court is now pending, the matter having finally been heard in March 2016.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn his television address Zuma took refuge behind the legal advice that he claimed had informed his original approach, citing the Western Cape High Court decision. This can only be described as an outrageously brazen and disingenuous ex post facto re-framing of the history of the matter.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt will not fool many.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EANC’s containment strategy\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EZuma is fighting desperately for his political life, staggering from one scandal or misjudgement to another. An hour after his live broadcast, Gwede Mantashe, the secretary-general of Zuma’s own party, the African National Congress, held his own press conference. He stated, several times, that the party does not “pivot” around any one leader. Mantashe said that the ANC welcomed the fact that Zuma had “humbled” himself before the nation.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs the ANC’s chief “traffic warden” and kingmaker, Mantashe is now the man who holds the key to Zuma’s future.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETo the uninitiated it may have looked like Mantashe and the ANC were pulling up the drawbridge in defence of Zuma, as he counter-attacked against opposition calls for Zuma to be impeached or removed by his own party. He told the media: \\u0026#8220;We will not play to the gallery.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut to more seasoned political watchers it was clear that Mantashe’s strategy of containing Zuma is gathering momentum and gaining traction. Tellingly, Mantashe announced that the ANC will shortly be holding an “extended” meeting of its national working committee.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis is a powerful sub-committee of the ruling party’s National Executive Committee—which is the only body that can “recall” Zuma, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://mg.co.za/article/2008-09-20-anc-recalls-mbeki\\\"\\u003Eas it did\\u003C/a\\u003E in the case of former President Thabo Mbeki in September 2008.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAn “extended” national working committee means that any other member of the national executive committee may attend. Who turns up may matter a great deal to Zuma’s future. He may still enjoy a majority of support on the national executive committee that was elected when he was re-elected as president of the ANC at its last national conference in December 2012. But that support is now on the wane. More recently the moderates and social democratic traditionalists in the ANC leadership have begun to find their voice in opposition to Zuma’s destabilizing rule.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe national working committee is also due to meet with the ANC’s parliamentary caucus. Until now they have used their majority of 63% of the seats in the National Assembly to vote down several motions of no confidence brought by the chief opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EParliament is in recess, so the decision to recall its parliamentary caucus suggests that events are moving fast within the ANC. This raises the question: if there is no crisis, then why all these meetings?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor the time being at least, Zuma is not ready to relinquish power. With the ruling on the lawfulness of the decision to drop the corruption charges against him looming he still has too much to lose by giving up the Presidency.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut Zuma is in the middle of a long and difficult week and perhaps sooner rather than later he may have to face the inevitable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/57180/count.gif\\\" alt=\\\"The Conversation\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://theconversation.com/profiles/richard-calland-182127\\\"\\u003ERichard Calland\\u003C/a\\u003E, Associate Professor in Public Law, \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cape-town\\\"\\u003EUniversity of Cape Town\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis article was originally published on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://theconversation.com\\\"\\u003EThe Conversation\\u003C/a\\u003E.

This time, too, the BJP is fighting for 88 of the 126 seats in the state legislature, and has given its coalition partners the remainder.

The state’s GDP grew by 5.87% in 2013-14. About a third of the population lives below the poverty line. About 86% of Assamese live in the countryside, but the share of agriculture in the economy has fallen steadily from about 55% in 1950 to about 17% last year. The share of industry has also been declining.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe 2011 Census showed that Assam was one of India’s worst-off states in terms of health and sanitation. Only 54.8% of households in Assam had access to drinking water within their premises, and only 10.5% had tap water. Assam is also one of India’s eight poorest states; a government document notes that it is “a unique example of poverty amidst plenty”.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is little doubt that after decades of Congress rule Assam is a failing state.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite this dismal track record, nobody I spoke with is willing to predict defeat for Gogoi or the Congress. The chief minister maintains his hold on his Titabar bailiwick; his 35-year-old son Gaurav, a political rookie, easily won his father’s old parliamentary constituency in 2014.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe anointing of the son as the heir apparent triggered the exit of Gogoi’s closest lieutenant, health and education minister and fund-raiser, Himanta Biswa Sarma.

He masterminded a stunning setback for Gogoi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with the BJP winning seven of Assam’s 14 lower house seats. The BJP’s “vision document” promises to “(work) closely with central government to achieve complete sealing of the Indo-Bangladesh border in Assam”.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESonowal says the border sealing has been made easier by the Land Boundary Agreement signed by Modi and Bangladesh’s prime minister Sheikh Hasina in June last year.

In the 2014 parliamentary election the AIUDF won three of Assam’s 14 Lok Sabha seats, as many as the Congress party. In fact, it is now the largest Muslim party in parliament’s lower house. “If there is a hung assembly, we will be a decisive force,” says Aditya Langthasa, the working president of the AIUDF.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAjmal, who also controls a formidable perfumery empire based in Mumbai and Dubai, owns huge Agar tree plantations in and around the town of Hojai.

Nine of the state’s 27 districts are now Muslim-majority.

Mahanta and his followers in the AGP are also deeply suspicious about the Modi government’s offer of citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh. “We want that the Assam Accord should be implemented in letter and spirit,” says the man who signed the accord in 1985. He says if Modi adopts a different policy, he should rehabilitate the migrants outside Assam.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Otherwise local Assamese people will become a minority in Assam.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMahanta says Modi’s offer of blanket citizenship to Hindu Bangladeshis is comparable with Israel’s embrace of the world’s Jews. Bangladesh’s Hindu minority totalled 20 million in 2013, and they could all seek asylum in India under the new citizenship rules. He asks how Assam can bear that burden. “Certainly I am disappointed…(Modi) swore he would not give an inch of Indian land to Bangladesh. Now he has also given away land to Bangladesh.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite his disappointment, Mahanta says it was important for parties such as the BJP and AGP to come together to topple the Congress.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELeft out in the cold: the Communists pray for a comeback\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAssam’s economic backwardness and ethnic and religious animosities have not benefited the Left parties. In 1978, just before the anti-foreigner agitation erupted, the Left parties together won 28 seats in the state assembly. They have never tasted such success since.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 2001 the communist parties did not win a single seat; in 2006 they won just two; and in 2011 they went back to zero. Their cadres came under fierce attack when the Bodo tribals launched their own protests in 1979 (the Bodoland People’s Front is now an ally of the BJP and the AGP).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough the Left parties have put up 59 candidates this election, their leaders are not brimming with confidence.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) office in Hedayetpur in Guwahati is deserted. A red sign says “There is no alternative to socialism”.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIsfaqur Rahman, a senior member of the party’s state secretariat tells me that identity politics and ethnic divisions have made things difficult for the communists. Even in the tea gardens, which used to once be strongholds, trade unions have dwindled from 59 to 25. The CPI(M) has only 119 full-time workers in all of Assam, Rahman says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“It is very difficult to attract the younger generation,” Rahman tells me as he lights up another cigarette. The senior leader complains good-naturedly that he himself has to get by on a monthly stipend of just Rs 5,000.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERahman is still better off than the homeless in Guwahati.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWalking the crowded and ramshackle streets of the state capital, stepping carefully over cement planks covering open and stinking sewers, I remember what Dwijen Sarma, a Gogoi man who was refused a ticket for the coming election, told me was one of his major achievements as a Guwahati city boss and chairman of the Housing Board.  “I have put up roofs at bus-stands so that the homeless can sleep somewhere at night,” he said.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt was time to look elsewhere for clues to Assam’s future.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"annotatable\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThis is the third in a series of reports on the political and social scene in Assam which goes to polls today (April 4).\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"annotatable\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFollow Chaitanya on Twitter \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ChaitanyaKalbag\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@chaitanyakalbag\\u003C/a\\u003E.

And indeed, this is the type of shameless storytelling tactic that could kill a lesser show. But this is \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Walking Dead\\u003C/em\\u003E—the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://adage.com/article/media/top-10-watched-entertainment-shows-2015/301908/\\\"\\u003Emost popular cable TV series\\u003C/a\\u003E in the world, and one whose ratings have stayed \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:The_Walking_Dead_ratings\\\"\\u003Emonstrously huge\\u003C/a\\u003E despite angering fans a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/2015/11/walking-dead-twitter-reaction/\\\"\\u003Enumber of times\\u003C/a\\u003E in the past.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELast night\\u0026#8217;s finale was no doubt the show\\u0026#8217;s most egregious affront to its fans yet, but there\\u0026#8217;s little reason to expect fans to abandon the show in droves. Fans of \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Walking Dead\\u003C/em\\u003E have become the real walking dead—mindlessly watching, even when some primal instinct within them is saying that the show is crap.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat may change, though, is how the show is written. AMC, the prestigious network responsible for \\u003Cem\\u003EBreaking Bad\\u003C/em\\u003E and \\u003Cem\\u003EMad Men\\u003C/em\\u003E, knows it can\\u0026#8217;t keep gambling with audience expectations, even if ratings continue to impress. In this social-media-focused age, AMC doesn\\u0026#8217;t control the show, the fans and critics do. \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Walking Dead\\u003C/em\\u003E belongs to geek culture now, and the network would be wise to listen to what its denizens are saying about the show\\u0026#8217;s storytelling mechanics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe reason I stopped watching the show wasn\\u0026#8217;t because of dumb cliffhangers. It was because the plot was awfully meandering, circling back again and again to the same story lines, the same moral dilemmas, the same hokey zombie fights. The writers might be able to promise fans to never include another asinine cliffhanger again, but they can\\u0026#8217;t promise me that they\\u0026#8217;ll suddenly come up with a new way to move the story forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EShowrunner Scott Gimple \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://screencrush.com/walking-dead-negan-cliffhanger-explanation/\\\"\\u003Ecompared the cliffhanger\\u003C/a\\u003E to a moment on the popular ABC series \\u003Cem\\u003ELost.\\u003C/em\\u003E (At the end of its first season, the characters finally open a mysterious hatch in the ground, but the audience doesn\\u0026#8217;t see what\\u0026#8217;s in it.) But that comparison misses two important points: First, \\u003Cem\\u003ELost\\u003C/em\\u003E, a mystery show, was predicated on those types of cliffhangers. Second, the show had earned that moment through a season of compelling storytelling. By all accounts, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Walking Dead\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u0026#8216;s cliffhanger wasn\\u0026#8217;t earned—it was thrown in solely to keep fans rabid while the show is off the air.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ELost \\u003C/em\\u003Ehad its fair share of silly moments, but at least it knew when to end. Its ratings were fantastic—it could have easily gone on for another season or two or ten, but the writers had told the story they wanted to tell. The arc was finished.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThe Walking Dead\\u003C/em\\u003E, meanwhile, has no end in sight (and, arguably, no arc at all). Most likely, it will limp on indefinitely, until the viewers find there\\u0026#8217;s no more flesh left to feast on, and are left to pick at its bones.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=654172\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-04T12:55:44-04:00\",\"category\":\"Glass\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/654172\",\"dc_creator\":\"Adam Epstein\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/twd_616_gp_1112_0183-rt-e1459785880410.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"amc the walking dead\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/twd_616_gp_1112_0183-rt-e1459785880410.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/654172/a-completely-asinine-cliffhanger-on-the-walking-dead-has-fans-in-uproar/"], ["published_at", Mon, 04 Apr 2016 16:55:44 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A completely asinine cliffhanger on &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221; has fans in an uproar"], ["updated_at", Mon, 04 Apr 2016 20:27:23 UTC +00:00]]

Essentially that there is strong downward pressure working its way through the product chain that will eventually reach Europe\\u0026#8217;s consumers, making the European Central Bank\\u0026#8217;s efforts to stave off broad-based price declines that much tougher. (The ECB has already pushed interest rates deeply into negative territory in order to get money circulating. The results have been mixed.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn other words, falling wholesale prices are yet another sign that the main macroeconomic problem facing the world right now is the ongoing risk of very low inflation or even outright deflation. Three of the world\\u0026#8217;s four largest economic entities are either in deflation, or threatened by it. Chinese wholesale prices are in free fall, as are those in Japan, where the economy has been locked in a decades-long battle to escape deflation. Only the US seems to be hanging in there—by a thread.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-654235\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/allproducer_price_indices_year-on-year_change__euro_zone_china_japan_us__chartbuilder.gif?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/allproducer_price_indices_year-on-year_change__euro_zone_china_japan_us__chartbuilder.gif?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis goes a long way toward explaining the US Federal Reserve\\u0026#8217;s shift away from an expected string of interest rate increases this year. The dovish turn appeared to catch markets by surprise, but it shouldn\\u0026#8217;t have. The low pressure system that\\u0026#8217;s hung over global price levels has been problematic for a while. All of this, by the way, should be a very good thing for stocks, at least in the short term, as it means that monetary policy will be easy for a good bit longer. Indeed, it\\u0026#8217;s one of the reasons US benchmark stock indexes have pulled back into positive territory for the year.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=654140\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-04T12:36:21-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/654140\",\"dc_creator\":\"Matt Phillips\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtsdf2f-e1459779011327.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"File photo of an employee of German car manufacturer Mercedes Benz working on the interior of a GLA model at their production line at the factory in Rastatt\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtsdf2f-e1459779011327.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/654140/an-incredibly-important-chart-that-you-probably-wont-see-anywhere-else-today/"], ["published_at", Mon, 04 Apr 2016 16:36:21 UTC +00:00], ["title", "An incredibly important chart that you probably won&#8217;t see anywhere else today"], ["updated_at", Mon, 04 Apr 2016 20:27:23 UTC +00:00]]

Jim’s writing had obsessed me equally, and the trip turned into a pilgrimage–driving through Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where Jim had had a writing cabin for many years, I happened to stay with some people who knew him, and Jim was kind enough to answer the phone when I called. (Jim was renowned for his writing and epicurean living, but it’s less known what a gracious, generous spirit he was.) We spent parts of two days talking in his new hometown of Livingston, Montana. I confessed all my anxieties about the work I felt called to and kept dodging. He sent me off with lines from a poem: “Be true / to your strange kind.”\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"s1\\\"\\u003EI had meant to, and failed to, write about that experience ever since–my memory of it was powerful, but episodic, as I hadn’t taken notes.

That night, I opened again a collection of his poems called \\u003Cem\\u003ELetters to Yesenin\\u003C/em\\u003E, written in 1973. Sergei Yesenin, the great Russian poet of the early 20th century, committed suicide in 1925 at 30, and \\u003Cem\\u003ELetters to Yesenin\\u003C/em\\u003E is Jim–who was then living on a farm in northern Michigan with a wife and two young daughters, trying to scratch out a living as a poet–working out how to step back from the same edge. He wrote it at more or less my age (I\\u0026#8217;m 37, he was 36), and through it somehow got himself living again. (“My year-old daughter\\u0026#8217;s red robe hangs from the doorknob shouting Stop.”) I had looked at that slim book a dozen times, but it was only that evening that it occurred to me how my recollections of Jim could be enough.

Charles Dickens routinely walked for 30 miles a day, while the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche declared, “All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut in recent years, as lives have become increasingly sedentary, the idea has been put to the test. The precise physiology is unknown, but professors and therapists are turning what was once an unquestioned instinct into a certainty: Walking influences our thinking, and somehow improves creativity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELast year, researchers at Stanford found that people \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-042414.html\\\"\\u003Eperform better on creative divergent thinking tests\\u003C/a\\u003E during and immediately after walking. The effect was similar regardless of whether participants took a stroll inside or stayed inside, walking on a treadmill and staring at a wall. The act of walking itself, rather than the sights encountered on a saunter, was key to improving creativity, they found.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDan Schwartz, who conducted the study and is Dean of Stanford Graduate School of Education, says in an interview that there are “very complicated” physiological changes associated with walking. It’s not exactly clear why walking is helpful to so many thinkers, but “it could be that the brain is focusing on doing a task it’s quite good at,” he adds, which then allows it to free up and relax.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EExercise is known \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise.aspx\\\"\\u003Eto improve mood\\u003C/a\\u003E, and so it’s likely that the aerobic activity has an effect. But it’s not clear whether more intense forms of exercise has exactly the same effect as walking.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“When I’m in good shape, my imagination can go, but when I’m in bad shape, all I can think about is how much it hurts,” says Schwartz, suggesting that perhaps the activity would have to be undemanding to have a creative boost.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBarbara Oakley, engineering professor at Oakland University who wrote \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Mind-For-Numbers-Science-Flunked/dp/039916524X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003Ea book about learning effectively\\u003C/a\\u003E which includes the benefit of walking, says in an interview that we make a mistake of thinking that we’re only learning when we’re focused. In fact, walking allows us subconsciously process and think in a different way.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Part of why walking, I think, is important is it can be boring. It’s that very aspect that causes your mind to go back and revisit, even subconsciously, on what you’ve been analyzing and learning,” she says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis “important part of the creative process” has helped her work many times, adds Oakley:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E““I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been working away and I’m completely stuck. Sometimes I’m so stuck I don’t even know I’m stuck. I finally get so frustrated I just get up. And as soon as I get out and have walked for ten or 15 minutes, these ideas start coming to me.

I’d spend weekends searching for the perfect bread recipe or perfecting my mother’s blueberry muffins. Baking was my therapy and my creative outlet.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThen I started baking for a living, and everything changed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen I opened Whisked!, a bakery in Washington, DC, I realized that my “fun” hobby was no longer quite so relaxing. Baking professionally is about being fast, efficient, and consistent. You’re executing the same recipes over and over again, week after week. If you accidentally use baking powder instead of baking soda, then you can potentially throw away hundreds of dollars worth of product. We are lugging around 50 pound bags of flour and sugar and making batches of cookies in a giant industrial mixer. It’s hard work, and it can be boring to make the same baked goods over and over again. But the success of my business relies on how well I and my team churn out these recipes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBaking is no longer a way to decompress after a long week—it’s a job. Thankfully, it’s a job that I love and that I’m good at. Here are a few other things I\\u0026#8217;ve learned since I turned my hobby into a career.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E1. Accept that you’re not good at some things. \\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERunning your own business forces you to do tasks you’ve never dealt with before, especially at the beginning. All of the sudden, you’re the salesperson, creative producer, marketer, bookkeeper and the financial manager. You won’t be good at all of those things.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor example, I’m a creative, big picture person, which is another way of saying that I’m pretty unorganized and not detail-oriented. I’ve gotten better since I started this business. But whenever I have to calculate how many chocolate chip cookies we need to make for the upcoming week, I still inevitably get it wrong.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs a good businessperson, you need to figure out what you’re bad at and balance it out. Hire a bookkeeper to do your reconciling, get a virtual assistant to manage your calendar or hire a salesperson to close those deals. Now, I have my production manager calculate how many cookies we need to make for the week, and we never run out of cookies. I use the time I previously spent on these calculations to develop new recipes and to do live demos at local stores—things I am good at and that make a real difference to the growth of my business.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd whatever you do, hire an accountant to set up your QuickBooks. Trust me on this one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E2. You won’t always be ready.\\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESometimes you need to say yes to an opportunity before you feel like you’re ready. When Whisked! first moved into a shared-kitchen incubator, I didn’t think we could take on a lot more clients. I was already working crazy long hours, had hired two kitchen helpers, and felt like I couldn’t fit any more deliveries into our schedule.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThen a big opportunity came my way: A chain of local supermarkets wanted to start carrying our products in three locations. I didn’t feel like we could take on the business, but I didn’t want to pass up on this new client.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo I said yes. Even though I felt like we were at our max, I decided to embrace the opportunity and figure it out. And I did. I added more storage space, hired another person, and changed our delivery schedule.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESometimes, you won’t feel ready to jump on a big opportunity. But you have to say yes and figure out the details later. Now that grocery chain is one of our biggest clients, and the extra revenue has allowed me to hire more staff, buy equipment and move into a larger kitchen with a bigger oven. If I had waited until I felt “ready” to bring that client on, I would have missed a great opportunity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E3. You can’t have an out.\\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ve seen a lot of people with well-paying jobs who start food businesses on the side. Once they get past the initial excitement of starting their own businesses, they realize how much work is involved and how difficult it is to make money right away. I’ve seen ma\\u003Cspan class=\\\"aBn\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"aQJ\\\"\\u003Eny of the\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003Ese people close up shop and go back to their steady paychecks. They had an out, so they took it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI don’t blame them. The food industry is really hard. The margins are small. It’s a challenging way to make a living. I’ve had many moments when I’ve been in the kitchen at two o’clock in the morning, baking cookies, and thought, “If I could only go back to my old nine-to-five, I wouldn’t have to be in this kitchen at this hour, work every weekend and wash dishes for hours every day.” If I could have gone back to my office job, I probably would have.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe only reason that I stuck it out through the tough years at the beginning is that I had to. I was miserable as an office worker and an indifferent communications professional. I couldn’t go back to that. So I stuck with it, made it work and eventually got us to where we are today.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E4. Good stuff sells—even in a saturated market.\\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo person with an MBA would ever tell you to start a cookie business. There are so many cookies on the market, from fresh-baked cookies at independent bakeries to mass-produced cookies like Oreos to high-end cookies like Tate’s Bake Shop. The world doesn’t need another cookie.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI thought so too, which is why my bakery first focused on pies, which very few DC bakeries did at the time. We thought pies could be a great niche. Although we also made some cookies, loaf cakes and other baked goods to sell at our farmers’ market stand, they were an afterthought compared to the pies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWell guess what? People really loved our cookies. When we started selling them in packs of six, people went crazy. We couldn’t bring enough of them to the market.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EToday, our packs of cookies are our best-selling item and the biggest driver of our growth. So apparently the world did need another cookie. Or maybe our cookies are just that good.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=658148\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-10T08:00:56-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/658148\",\"dc_creator\":\"Jenna Huntsberger\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtxf0fy.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Cookies\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtxf0fy.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/658148/what-i-learned-when-i-turned-my-baking-hobby-into-a-full-time-job/"], ["published_at", Sun, 10 Apr 2016 12:00:56 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What I learned when I turned my baking hobby into a full-time job"], ["updated_at", Mon, 11 Apr 2016 00:52:47 UTC +00:00]]

Nearly a year later, it\\u0026#8217;s become apparent that there really isn\\u0026#8217;t much of a need to get one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe smartwatch was the first entirely new product that Apple had released in five years, the first launched under CEO Tim Cook\\u0026#8217;s oversight—as well the first product in decades launched by Apple without the direction of Steve Jobs behind it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESome argued that it was the product that would give us insight into the future of Apple. A year later, that direction appears to be \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/644889/apple-is-boring-now/\\\"\\u003Every boring\\u003C/a\\u003E. The short-term roadmap seems to be focused on iterations of existing products, and selling accessories, like new watchbands, for those products. But the Apple Watch is in itself an accessory, entirely tied to a person\\u0026#8217;s iPhone, and hasn\\u0026#8217;t shown that it can perform enough useful functions to make the average person think, yes, this is something that\\u0026#8217;s worth a few hundred dollars as it\\u0026#8217;s exciting and will help me in my life.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEvery Apple product in the last 15 years or so has been two things: desirable and useful. They\\u0026#8217;ve made it easier for people to be creative, listen to a lot of music on the go, communicate with anyone in the world or find out any piece of information wherever they are.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Apple Watch looks good, but from a desirability perspective, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/656931\\\"\\u003Esome argue\\u003C/a\\u003E that the most interesting thing about it has been the collaborations it has had with Hermès, rather than the watch itself. Even Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, in a recent Reddit \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/\\\"\\u003Equestion-and-answer session,\\u003C/a\\u003E was inclined to agree:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EI worry a little bit about – I mean I love my Apple Watch, but – it’s taken us into a jewelry market where you’re going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person. The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band’s the only difference? Well this isn’t the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn terms of usability, the watch has proven a tough sell. US presidential hopeful and \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://vine.co/v/erX66WYXx6p\\\"\\u003Edie-hard Apple fan\\u003C/a\\u003E Jeb Bush \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/13/10764430/jeb-bush-apple-watch-phone-call-video\\\"\\u003Edidn\\u0026#8217;t even know\\u003C/a\\u003E his Apple Watch could make and receive calls. The tiny screen doesn\\u0026#8217;t lend itself to complicated interactions, and third-party and native apps have struggled to show that they\\u0026#8217;re more useful than, say, just looking at the full-fledged apps on your phone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI really like paying for things with my Apple Watch. The servers at the coffee shop that I\\u0026#8217;ve gone to every morning for the last year or so never remembered me from one day to the next. But then, when they got a new payments terminal that accepted Apple Pay, they started remembering me, and one server now refers to me as \\u0026#8220;the Apple Watch guy.\\u0026#8221; And that\\u0026#8217;s who I am now. No one would say that about someone whipping out a new iPhone or Macbook. Though if I started riding in every morning on a hoverboard, or started wearing VR goggles in-store, I\\u0026#8217;d probably get a new nickname.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EApple has always prided itself on \\u0026#8216;thinking different\\u0026#8217;, and has stood out by creating differentiating products. But different in the case of the Apple Watch right now just means \\u0026#8220;weird.\\u0026#8221; Apple probably doesn\\u0026#8217;t want a product where using one gets you referred to as \\u0026#8220;that guy.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn an article for the New York Times this week, Kit Eaton \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/technology/personaltech/what-the-apple-watch-does-one-year-later.html\\\"\\u003Eshowed off\\u003C/a\\u003E (paywall) some of his favorite apps for the Watch. There was a decent grocery-list-making app, a nice text-based game, and a sleep-tracking app. This was, presumably, the best he could find for a device that you have to charge every 18 hours or so, and costs about \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Unisex-T2N654-Weekender-Watch/dp/B004VR9J0A?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003Eten times more\\u003C/a\\u003E than a functional watch that does a better, quicker job of telling you the time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11326360/new-ipad-pro-review-9-7-inch-2016\\\"\\u003Ebest iPad\\u003C/a\\u003E costs about $900 (including the keyboard and stylus), and the best iPhone starts at $650. But iPhone and iPad sales are either \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/603555/apple-is-preparing-for-a-future-where-individual-iphone-sales-dont-matter/\\\"\\u003Estagnating or declining\\u003C/a\\u003E. This may well change with the new iPad Pro, a potential laptop-killer for the average person, and whatever new iPhone Apple launches later this year. But Apple really needs a new, cheaper device to grow beyond the cycle of iPhone replacements. That was supposed to be the Apple Watch.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"atlas-chart\\\" data-id=\\\"4JDFXplFl\\\" data-width=\\\"640\\\" data-height=\\\"409\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_4JDFXplFl.png\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 100%;\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EApple hasn\\u0026#8217;t said how many watches it has sold—wasn\\u0026#8217;t immediately available to comment for this story—but \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/535697/apple-has-probably-sold-more-than-5-million-watches-so-far/\\\"\\u003Eestimates suggest\\u003C/a\\u003E upwards of 5 million have been sold to date. Apple sold nearly 75 million iPhones in the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/603258/were-live-charting-apples-big-first-quarter-earnings-report/\\\"\\u003Elast quarter of 2015\\u003C/a\\u003E alone, which leaves a lot of people who have iPhones and didn\\u0026#8217;t see the need to tack on a $300-or-more accessory to that purchase. Considering \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/319016/only-5-of-us-iphone-users-say-theyre-very-likely-to-buy-an-apple-watch/\\\"\\u003Esome estimates show\\u003C/a\\u003E that over 60% of US adults wear watches, there should have been a lot of room for growth.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne of the Watch\\u0026#8217;s saving graces is its activity tracking abilities. I\\u0026#8217;ve found the heart-rate, step and exercize monitoring functions to be simpler, more useful, and more reliable, than other ecosystems—like Jawbone and Fitbit.  Still, many companies make far cheaper health-tracking devices.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EApple does seem to be making a push into healthcare that could point to a more useful future for the watch.  At its most recent product launch event, Apple unveiled CareKit, a framework for developers to build apps that will help us keep better track of our vitals and health on a daily basis. Caitlin McGarry at Macworld believes it will end up \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3048250/ios/our-bodies-ourselves-how-carekit-apps-will-revolutionize-health-care.html\\\"\\u003Erevolutionizing healthcare\\u003C/a\\u003E, and will \\u0026#8220;bridge the gap between quantifying our health and actually doing something about it.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough the initial apps and structure are for the iPhone, Apple could add the Watch into this. Healthcare could well end up being the thing that gives the Watch a reason to be.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EReports \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/08/apple-watch-2-debut-wwdc-june-brian-white/\\\"\\u003Eare trickling out\\u003C/a\\u003E that the next version of the Apple Watch will be released this June, and will be 40% thinner than the current models. It\\u0026#8217;s unclear if it will also be 40% more useful, but it\\u0026#8217;s worth remembering that the first iPod, iPhone and iPad were also relatively clunky devices, that—especially for the iPod and iPad—were not met with unanimous praise.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDoes Apple have anything else up its sleeve that could hit that sub-$500 price to attract new customers?

For just over 24 hours, my community is made up solely of people I can physically see and touch. The digital disconnect was a little challenging at first as I worked to incorporate adjustments here and there, both at work and otherwise. But with the kinks finally ironed out, observing Shabbos became an incredible gift to myself, something I looked forward to every week. Friday means meals with lots of friends and few distractions and no alarms to wake up to in the morning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, my new lifestyle is about much more than catching up on sleep. My Friday afternoons have become ritualistic, with trips to the bakery for challah bread, the farmers market for fresh vegetables, and the supermarket for everything else. Hours of cooking before friends come over for dinner. Wine and conversation. Very few, if any, glances at screens during the meal. Some Jewish blessings, and maybe a little singing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EAfter so many years avoiding my religion, I think I finally understand why my father made such a big deal about Shabbat growing up.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EAfter so many years avoiding my religion, I think I finally understand why my father made such a big deal about Shabbat growing up. I have even become something of a Shabbat evangelist, preaching its benefits to my friends, fiancé, and coworkers—even the non-Jewish ones. It is more than a day of rest; it is a day of community and rejuvenation, a celebration of the week past and preparation for the week to come.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd yet, the benefits of religious life do not obscure its sexism. Judaism is, of course, a patriarchy. (Long before I knew what a patriarchy meant, I knew that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were the Patriarchs—and the Matriarchs always felt like an afterthought.) The Torah, our original text, opens with the story of Adam and Eve, establishing women as secondary to men from day one, literally. Eve is an accessory made from Adam’s rib. She lures him into sin and is repaid with the curse of painful childbearing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd it doesn’t get much better for women from there. The Talmud, the books of Jewish law written in the first century of the Common Era, devotes a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/niddah-tractate\\\"\\u003Eten-chapter tractate\\u003C/a\\u003E on the topic of menstruation, in which the all male sages debate the specific laws around women’s menstrual blood, including for example, how long it makes them unclean and what kinds of examinations can confirm whether or not they are still bleeding. Even today, daily morning prayers include a blessing wherein men thank God for not making them women.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELike many religions, Judaism is nuanced and complex. Jewish lore is full of female symbols of righteousness and power—like Moses’s sister Miriam, who becomes a Jewish leader in her own right; and my personal favorite, Yael, who slays the Canaanite general Sisera by driving a tent peg through his skull as he sleeps. \\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EYet the benefits of religious life do not obscure its sexism.

Most of the Bible’s women are wives, mothers and daughters; as in the case of my own namesake, they are often victims, too. The argument that Jewish law places women in a special position—often used by religious organizations like Chabad to explain the differences in treatment—is more reminiscent of misguided concepts of chivalry than any sense of real equality.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEven more unfortunate, modern Jewish life still too often reflects these sexist attitudes, whether via widely accepted practices like gendered school dress codes or more controversial ones, like forcing to move from their assigned seats on airplanes, banning them from conducting religious services at the Western Wall, or preventing them from getting a divorce without a husband’s consent.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI guess what I’m trying to say is that my relationship to religion remains a complicated one. Jewish culture is still my culture—and I have decided to allow myself to enjoy it, to participate in this patriarchy on my own terms. This year, I read the Torah on the twentieth anniversary of my Bat Mitzvah in what was both a religious act and, for someone who went to Orthodox schools growing up, a rebellious one. \\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E Jewish culture is still my culture—I have decided to allow myself to enjoy it, to participate in this patriarchy on my own terms. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EUnlike Conservative or Reform strains, Orthodox Judaism does not allow a woman to read from the Torah with men present; the sound of a woman’s voice singing is apparently too tempting to withstand. (In ninth grade, I both amazed and horrified my Orthodox male classmates by showing them I knew how to read the Torah. They had never been to a Bat Mitzvah where a woman was allowed to do such a thing. It felt incredible.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI still light Shabbat candles on Friday night, even if it’s a practice, according to some explanations, meant to atone for what Eve did in Eden. When I go to my Bubbe’s Orthodox synagogue after I am married, I will keep my hair covered—but it will be out of respect for Bubbe (and the opportunity to buy some new hats), not acquiescence to the patriarchal dicta. I am not going to change Judaism, but I can control the way I practice it. After all, there is nothing quite as Jewish as picking and choosing which rules to follow and which to ignore.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough to my friends it may seem like I have become more religious over the past year, I would have to disagree. I didn’t need to find my religion—it hadn’t gone anywhere. I simply needed to figure out how to practice my faith in a way that stayed true to all of my values. In doing so, I discovered a way to let religion into my life without resenting myself for it. I am neither a perfect feminist nor a perfect Jew, but I no longer think either is mutually exclusive. And so I remain happily in the middle.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFollow Deena on Twitter at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/deenashanker?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\\\"\\u003E@deenashanker\\u003C/a\\u003E.

Social and economic structures have typically been designed for married couples and so, as the number of unmarried women increases, so does the pressure to break out of these conservative constructions. Journalist Rebecca Traister explores the idea in depth in her book, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/All-Single-Ladies-Unmarried-Independent/dp/1476716560?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003EAll the Single Ladies,\\u003C/a\\u003E published last month. She details stories of unmarried women who had significant impact throughout history, growing acceptance of remaining single, and how unmarried women have long been a powerful political force.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe progressive impact of single women makes sense, given that marriage seems to make women more politically conservative. Kelsy Kretschmer, sociology professor at Oregon State University, says her research shows that after marriage, women tend to shift their priorities from promoting women\\u0026#8217;s collective wellbeing to that of their partner\\u0026#8217;s success.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Their loyalty is split away from other women and they have to be concerned about their husband’s security as well,” she says in an interview. Kretschmer’s research found that single women feel \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.asanet.org/press/unmarried_women_politically_cohesive.cfm\\\"\\u003E10% more connected\\u003C/a\\u003E towards other women than those who are married.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere’s no clear-cut explanation for why single women are more liberal than their married counterparts, but Monique Morrissey, economist at the Economic Policy Institute, says it makes sense that since single women are more economically vulnerable, they also tend to want a stronger social safety net. Married women “become more complacent because they’re not as self-reliant,” says Morrissey.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs a result, single women feel a particularly urgent need to demand change on issues such as equal pay, free childcare, and caregiver employment rights.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHeather Boushey, chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, and author of \\u003Cem\\u003EFinding Time: The Economics of Work-Life Conflict\\u003C/em\\u003E, says that “the rise of single women is a big trend that creates increased demand for policies that allow people to better manage their time.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMany of the foundations for America’s current social and labor policy were laid out during the 1930s, including legislation on being overworked, minimum wage, and income support for those who cannot work, adds Boushey in an email.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“While these are all important rules governing time, they no longer reflect the ways we live and work today and the reasons for which a worker may need to be away from work for a view days or weeks, such as to care for a new child or an ailing family member,” she says. “In a world where most families no longer have the \\u0026#8216;silent partner\\u0026#8217; at home to provide care and deal with all of life’s big and little emergencies, the reality is that in order to be fully productive members of our economy, most workers need new rules to help them address conflicts over work and life—rules that address time use.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course these issues affect married women too, and it’s difficult to clearly distinguish the political impact of single women versus that of career women overall. But with their more liberal views and greater economic vulnerability, single women are a powerful source for demanding that institutions adapt to benefit those outside traditional marriage.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=658627\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-10T08:00:00-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/658627\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-456263466.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Pro-choice Abortion Rally In Madrid\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gettyimages-456263466.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/658627/there-is-a-powerful-relationship-between-the-population-of-single-women-and-social-progress/"], ["published_at", Sun, 10 Apr 2016 12:00:00 UTC +00:00], ["title", "There is a powerful relationship between the population of single women and social progress"], ["updated_at", Mon, 11 Apr 2016 00:52:47 UTC +00:00]]

He pointed to legal and medical documents that referred to a first and second sleep, and similar mentions throughout literature, including Homer, Chaucer, Austen, Dickens, and Tolstoy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Practically every great author” mentioned to the practice, says Ekirch in an interview, and in every language in Europe.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut though we may feel perfectly happy with our modern consolidated sleep, we’ve now lost that midnight hour between sleeps, a time when we can be awake and alone with our thoughts.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“I think we’re missing out on a time of intimacy and privacy, a time of self-reflection,” says Ekirch. “We’ve lost a traditional avenue to our dreams, our subconscious.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis time, which those in earlier centuries called “the watch,” was once used for all manner of activities. There were prayers specifically designed for the watch, and as several religious faiths saw it as a “sacred hour best suited for communicating with God,\\u0026#8221; says Ekirch. It was also a chance to reflect on vivid dreams and meditate in bed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMore active types used the hour to check on sick family members, do basic chores such as setting the table, or even use the cover of darkness to filch apples from the neighbor’s orchard. As everyone would wake at a different time, even within the same family, it was an hour typically free from social demands. Ekirch says he found the letters of one 15\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E century Italian woman who loved the watch, as a time “when she’s not surrounded by men, performing chores for men.” Instead, she was able to work on embroidery or compose letters in privacy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOverall, Erkich suspects we’re less connected to our dreams as a result of no longer waking between sleeps. He says it seems “more than coincidental” that since segmented sleep became less common, dreams have “became a source of ridicule rather than instruction.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd the consolidation of sleep, which robs us of this hour of calm isolation, could also contribute to rising stress. “I think it’s common sense,” says Ekirch. “The ability to reflect upon the preceding day in the privacy of darkness, to anticipate one’s activities for the next day.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDoctors from previous centuries also believed in various medical benefits that came from taking medication during the watch, or changing sleeping position. One 16\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E century French doctor, whose view was later endorsed by several British physicians, argued that having sex between sleeps was key for couples hoping to conceive. This interval, the doctor wrote of French peasants, is when “they enjoy it more and do it better.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDon\\u0026#8217;t get too excited about that passionate, middle-of-the-night French peasant sex though. While segmented sleep comes with plenty of benefits, Ekirch says it would be impossible to truly recreate today without depriving yourself of artificial light. Sure, you might be able to temporarily sleep in two phases, as Jesse Barton recounted. But light has \\u0026#8220;a profound impact on the human body clock,\\u0026#8221; he says, and we cannot experience the true sleeping experience of the pre-Edison era without turning off the lightbulbs that surround us—for good.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHowever, the successes of segmented sleep should help ease the anxieties of those who suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia. Ekirch says that many who wake in dead of the night, but are able to return to sleep only after an hour or so, are often relieved to hear that there’s nothing wrong with them. After all, he adds, “Viewed from the high ground of history, their segmented sleep is arguably more natural than the very young, modern, artificial sleep to which we aspire.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=658571\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-10T07:00:46-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/658571\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/sleeping.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"sleeping\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/sleeping.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/658571/the-many-forgotten-benefits-of-segmented-sleep/"], ["published_at", Sun, 10 Apr 2016 11:00:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The many forgotten benefits of segmented sleep"], ["updated_at", Mon, 11 Apr 2016 00:52:47 UTC +00:00]]
