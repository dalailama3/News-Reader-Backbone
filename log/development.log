But his ascendancy is no surprise to Rick Shenkman, author of a \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Political-Animals-Stone-Age-Brain-Politics/dp/0465033008?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003EPolitical Animals\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E published earlier this year, who writes on how human’s stone-age instincts are poorly suited to the modern political era.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese ancient instincts explain why so many are instinctively drawn to Trump, says Shenkman.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLess educated voters are particularly vulnerable to Trump’s demagoguery, he says, as they have no alternative source of knowledge to counter their biological instincts. “His base is low-information voters and he’s just coming right out and saying it: ‘\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/politics/trump-i-love-the-poorly-educated-144008662.html\\\"\\u003EI love the poorly educated\\u003C/a\\u003E,’” he adds.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne of the strongest instincts is tribalism, says Shenkman, as we instinctively favor those with shared ancestry:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Donald Trump began his election in June, he’s been activating an ancient instinct in human brains, which is fear of the other. For many people, who lack other knowledge on which they can make their judgments about Mexican immigrants of Muslims coming into the United States, this winds up becoming a powerful trigger for their political beliefs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut Trump is only successful at activating these triggers because the modern political system tends to confuse our biological instincts. Our brains developed during the Pleistocene era, around 10,000 years ago, at a time when we were living in groups of 25 to 150 people. Humans lived and worked with their political leaders, and so could learn whether or not they trusted them first-hand. Today, the process is entirely artificial and we “get to know” politicians from TV appearances.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, the natural human tendency to lie has also muddied modern politics. “We all have the idea that human beings seek out and care about the truth,\\u0026#8221; Shenkman says. \\u0026#8220;But a key part of the evolution of human beings was the development of deception. We’re all cheaters at heart.” Humans have long had the ability to deceive and even our closest relative, chimpanzees, have \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=eHV_8YC_NL0C\\u0026amp;pg=PA247\\u0026amp;lpg=PA247\\u0026amp;dq=roger+fouts+lucy+deception\\u0026amp;source=bl\\u0026amp;ots=77x4ScfJjQ\\u0026amp;sig=ZeAUvKViuKzegHehX_tbyZGTTCg\\u0026amp;hl=en\\u0026amp;sa=X\\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI7K65mvDLAhXI6x4KHSqWDCUQ6AEIHDAA\\\"\\u003Ebeen found to lie\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince our brain is uncomfortable with dissonance, if we’re told a politician we instinctively like has lied, we’ll come up with excuses to dismiss the idea. We’re not so committed to the truth that we readily accept a challenge to our worldview.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“If you’re a Democrat and you catch a Republican lying, you’ll just be appalled,” Shenkman says. “But if you’re a Republican and a Republican gets caught in a lie, your partisan brain will kick into action, you’ll think up a million reasons why this person really didn’t lie.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat\\u0026#8217;s more, the distance between political figures and the electorate means we struggle to recognize deception. Humans\\u0026#8217; abilities to recognize lies developed at a time when we lived in far smaller groups in close proximity to each other, and such judgments simply don’t work as well when scrutinizing brief, distant, scripted media appearances.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf this sounds dpressing, Shenkman adds that we have the means, through culture and education, of countering our instincts. He points out that in May 1916, 15,000 gathered to watch Jesse Washington lynched in Waco, Texas. In the 100 years since, education has overridden our primordial fear of outsiders so that American mobs no longer delight in such cruelty. “We’re not slaves to our instincts,” says Shenkman. “We do have higher-order cognitive thinking.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch3\\u003ERead this next: \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/645345/inside-the-trump-machine-the-bizarre-psychology-of-americas-newest-political-movement/\\\"\\u003EInside the Trump machine: the bizarre psychology of America’s newest political movement\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/h3\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653524\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-02T12:05:47-04:00\",\"category\":\"2016\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653524\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rts68ht.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTS68HT\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rts68ht.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653524/trump-supporters-are-operating-on-biological-instinct/"], ["published_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:05:47 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Trump supporters are operating on biological instinct"], ["updated_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:07:04 UTC +00:00]]

Right now, the tiny quadcopter can skim into small spaces, perhaps to inspect a clogged pipe. But in the future, it might be able to do things such as assist in a hostage rescue.

Its origin story—a microbe isolated from the breast milk of a woman living far away from the corrupting influence of modernity—is touted as part of its appeal.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn many ways, Casas\\u0026#8217;s ideas were ahead of their time. Thirty years later, as research on the human microbiome has taken off, many microbiologists now make a similar argument. People in the developed world may have lost certain \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19898491/\\\"\\u003Eheirloom-like, mutualistic microbes\\u003C/a\\u003E, they say (including, it turns out, \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri\\u003C/em\\u003E, which does indeed \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3063604/\\\"\\u003Eseem to be disappearing\\u003C/a\\u003E from westernized populations). Our health may be suffering as a consequence of these losses, contributing to the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/among-trillions-of-microbes-in-the-gut-a-few-are-special/\\\"\\u003Erise in recent decades of asthma\\u003C/a\\u003E, autoimmune diseases, obesity, diabetes, and more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf we can restore the bugs that have disappeared, some argue, perhaps we can reverse the trend, treat, and even prevent these disorders. We in the developed world could “rewild” our bodies, goes the theory, with microbes derived from, say, Amerindian hunter-gatherers. Arguably, anyone who imbibes BioGaia’s \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri protectis\\u003C/em\\u003E is already doing a version of that.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe’re still a long way away from actually repopulating our bodies with “primeval” flora. Scientists are just beginning to catalog microbes from non-westernized groups and they still have no idea which are beneficial, which are harmful, or if such a transfer is even possible, let alone desirable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENevertheless, the microbiome field is making rapid progress in figuring out how to extract good bacteria from people and using them to treat various conditions. The shining success so far—the fecal transplant, which is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205037\\\"\\u003Eover 90% effective\\u003C/a\\u003E in vanquishing colitis, caused by the gut pathogen \\u003Cem\\u003EClostridium difficile\\u003C/em\\u003E—is essentially a crude form of microbial ecosystem restoration, in other words, the transplant of a healthy person’s microbiome to a diseased person.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECompanies like Seres Therapeutics and Vedanta Biosciences are working to develop more refined products—US government-approved therapies to treat obesity and inflammatory diseases, using microbes harvested from other healthy people in the developed world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUltimately, though, the only way to recover certain essential bugs lost to us in the developed world may be to acquire them from people who, like Dr. Casas’s Peruvian woman, still have them. And so, microbiologists are hurrying to study the microbes of peoples living more “traditional” lifestyles, including \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/3/e1500183\\\"\\u003EAmerindians in the Amazon\\u003C/a\\u003E, east African \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140415/ncomms4654/full/ncomms4654.html\\\"\\u003Ehunter-gatherers\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247%2815%2900340-X\\\"\\u003EPapuans\\u003C/a\\u003E, before their microbiomes modernize—before they urbanize, get flush toilets, take copious antibiotics, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/how-the-western-diet-has-derailed-our-evolution\\\"\\u003Etransition to a refined-food diet\\u003C/a\\u003E, and do all the other things thought to distort and deplete the human microbiota.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt this point, scientists are careful to characterize the research as purely descriptive. They’re only trying to understand what’s there, they say, and what it does. Yet the mere possibility of one day rewilding our bodies with microbes harvested from other people raises a fraught question: Who owns these microbes, and how should we compensate them for their use? Say that a microbial mix originally isolated from a Yanomami tribesman becomes a bestseller fix for asthma. Should the donor, or his tribe, receive a share of the profits? For that matter, did that Peruvian woman receive compensation? (Bo Möllstam, BioGaia’s technical director, says that the company is careful to comply with research ethics requirements of the countries it works in, and it did so in that case.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne line of thinking holds that because microbes are widespread and naturally occurring, they don’t belong to anyone. You can patent treatments and methods, or genetically modified organisms, but you can’t patent free-living organisms, even if those organisms are living on your body. Sure, donors can be compensated for time and effort—on average, the stool banking non-profit OpenBiome pays its donors up to $4,320 a year—but ultimately, it’s scientific know-how that transforms human feces into medicine.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The donors didn\\u0026#8217;t come up with the knowledge that allowed us to create an ecosystem,” says Emma Allen-Vercoe, a microbiologist at the University of Guelph in Canada. As it is, there’s already too much red tape slowing research, she says. The field doesn’t need more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere’s the wrinkle, though: Ivan Casas went to the Peruvian Andes precisely because he thought those populations had something Americans didn’t. Ditto with the scientists now studying peoples in the Amazon or East Africa. They suspect the microbiomes of these populations are unique and unlike our own—a suspicion that has so far proven correct. Amerindians in the Amazon harbor up 50% more microbial species than North Americans. They possess microbes we simply don’t.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMaria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, a microbiologist at New York University who studies remote Amerindian groups, feels strongly that, legal reasoning aside, there\\u0026#8217;s a \\u003Cem\\u003Emoral\\u003C/em\\u003E obligation to share the benefits of research with subjects. Compensation can raise other sticky issues, though. For instance, how do you pay an Amerindian hunter-gatherer who has no use for money? You might give them medicine and goods—they particularly like digital cameras, Dominguez-Bello says—or open a health clinic, but then you begin changing their way of life.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We spoil the very place we come to study,” she says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBioGaia’s Möllstam acknowledges these concerns as “something that needs to be dealt with in a serious way.” “We need to realize that we need to share whatever comes out of [research]”, he says. But modern gene sequencing technology may also make the issue moot. These days, when scientists understand how a healthful bacterium works, they can study its genome and find other microbes that behave the same way—something that was impossible in the past. BioGaia, which has a catalog of thousands of \\u003Cem\\u003EL. reuteri\\u003C/em\\u003E strains, wouldn’t go to Peru today searching for lactobacilli, he says, because it wouldn’t need to.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“When you know what you’re looking for,” he says, “you can pick microbes up almost anywhere.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=637744\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-02T07:00:03-04:00\",\"category\":\"Life as Laboratory\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/637744\",\"dc_creator\":\"Moises Velasquez-Manoff\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/microbes_1600x900_02.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Microbes_1600x900_02\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/microbes_1600x900_02.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/637744/should-we-rewild-our-urban-bodies-with-microbes-from-indigenous-peoples/"], ["published_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 11:00:03 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Should we &#8220;rewild&#8221; our urban bodies with microbes from indigenous peoples?"], ["updated_at", Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:07:04 UTC +00:00]]

First ,  if you want to see the size of the Indian internet economy, you must include chunks of Google, Facebook, Twitter and others in it,  because these are India’s leading internet companies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1249\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EThere are several ways to do it. One is to look at global revenues and market caps of these companies and attribute the Indian market cap to the share of Indian revenue in the global pie. I tried that, but came across a big issue: not knowing the Indian revenues of many of these firms, because it’s not separately called out.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"091d\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EI tried it a second way : to attribute the India-linked market cap to the Indian share of the firm’s global users, and that data was a little more accessible. I took all data from public sources such as press releases or estimates from SimilarWeb and the like. Wherever available, I took user or customer numbers (in regular font below), and where it was not available, I’ve taken traffic numbers (in italics below). And instead of private company valuations that would count Uber and such — I’ve taken more conservative public company valuations.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EOh, and further, all mistakes are mine alone.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"4327\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EHere’s what I came up with.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-653427\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/table.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/table.jpg?quality=80\\u0026strip=all\\u0026w=800\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-camera\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(Mahesh Murthy)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"5d97\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\u003EThe top 10 global internet companies have a combined market cap of over $1.3 trillion. But one can attribute up to $150 billion to Indian users.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"07cd\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EYes, of course, there is a large caveat here. First that, as said before, the Indian share of global revenues will give a more accurate picture. And our share of revenues will certainly be less than our share of traffic or users. So, you can discount this number by 25%, 50% or even 75% to adjust for that — but the final number is still significant. Though I do think market caps are not just a function of revenues . User base is also a prime consideration — after all that’s where the growth will come from.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"2f03\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ENow if you add the $30 billion or so of market cap of our local unicorns to this $150 billion, we’ll end up with around $180 billion of market cap for our current internet economy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"dbbd\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EThen, adjust for the fact that China has 720 million internet users and India has exactly half, 360 million users. $520 billion of Chinese market cap per head across 720 million users is $722 per user. Our number turns out to $180 billion of market cap across 360 million users — or $500 per user.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"dba4\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo the real difference between the Chinese internet potential and Indian internet potential is not 10x or 15x — but perhaps closer to 40% or 1.4x. Or you can be pessimistic and call it 2x if you like. But 10x it isn’t.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"8e40\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EWhat are the takeaways here?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"4b27\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EFirst that there just isn’t as much headroom for growth in the broad internet economy for startups in India as you’ve been told there is. The $180 billion may grow over a few years to $300 billion . But between $200 billion and $250 billion of that will accrue to non-Indian firms, leaving between $50 and $100 billion for Indian startups. Please adjust your expectations accordingly.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1bd0\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo, a more apt way of looking at the Indian potential is to see us like the 51st state of the US. Or like a UK. Large market for global companies — not necessarily a large market for local firms.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"7e7f\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EI’d say much of the growth assumed for our current unicorns is probably vastly over-estimated. Especially if the Indian unicorn has global competition in its way.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"ca17\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESecond, the nature of internet businesses is largely a winner-take-all in any niche. If you see the market share that Google ended up with in search, Gmail in email, Facebook in social networking, Twitter in microblogging, YouTube in video etc , they’re all well above 80%. So if you take on a niche , you either end up the leader with 80% of it, or a distant no. 2 with 8% of it or a non-player with 0.8% of it. This is where the chips largely tend to fall, though there are a few exceptions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"5976\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo, your likely playbook if you take on a global internet company are (a) to be bought by the global player or (b) to end up eventually as the 8% play.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"1b3c\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003ESo what’s going to happen to Flipkart now that Amazon and Alibaba have declined to buy it? Or to Ola now that Uber has declined to buy it? It may not be the nicest of news, I believe.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"751d\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EWhich leads us to the third take-away. If you want to build a large internet business in India , then do it out of the way of the globals. Build something where the globals aren’t. From my own portfolio, I’d suggest that RedBus, CarWale, MyDentist, Chumbak and others have picked the right areas. Other firms such as InMobi, Naukri and Paytm, too, are on paths outside the globals’ footprints. This is a good place to be over the long term , unless you’re sure you can sell out to a global like Baazee did to eBay. I personally believe this is extremely risky as the global firm may just turn around and say “nope, I’ll build it myself”, as many are increasingly doing so.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\\"229b\\\" class=\\\"graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\u003EAnd the fourth takeaway is for these firms to go global too. Naukri has expanded to West Asia. Chumbak is in Japan. InMobi is all over. And we’ll do better to expand to 2nd and 3rd world countries than taking on the first world.

AbstractController::DoubleRenderError - Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".:

While in Virginia, he visits friends and takes daily walks, in an effort to integrate himself with the community.

He adds:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The likelihood of danger is remote in the extreme. This is an easy one in some respects. Yet the political fallout of the crime is so great that these experiments in freedom, which the court has continued to allow, have been very incremental and slow.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA shocking verdict\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince the shooting, Hinckley’s experiences in court have not gone according to expectations. At the time of his trial, Alan Stone, professor of law and psychiatry at Harvard Law School, went on national television to predict, “There was no chance he’d be found not guilty by reason of insanity.” Typically, the insanity defense is only successful when the prosecution agrees to it—not when it’s contested. Valerie Hans, law professor at Cornell Law School, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/334/\\\"\\u003Econducted a study\\u003C/a\\u003E on the public’s reaction post-verdict, and says that many were furious that attacking the US leader had seemingly gone unpunished.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“There was a sense among the public that this was the wrong outcome, even if the details were lost on them,” she says. Many seemed to think the insanity defense was “quite literally getting away with murder.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA shift in the law\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough it was difficult to successfully plead not guilty by reason of insanity in 1981, it became even more challenging \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Henry-Steadman-PhD-Evaluating-1993-06-05/dp/B014BH92RE?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003Esince Hinckley’s trial\\u003C/a\\u003E. In particular, the burden of proof shifted, so that instead of the prosecution having to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane, it became the role of the defense to prove that the defendant was criminally insane. This marked a major turning point in US insanity defense law, says Hans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We had been moving in a direction towards greater accommodation of people with mental illness and there were expansive insanity defense laws,” she says. “After his verdict, the federal government and the state government wound up modifying and restricting further what could happen.” In Delaware, for example the state \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://law.justia.com/cases/delaware/supreme-court/1988/538-a-2d-1104-4.html\\\"\\u003Emodified the not guilty by reason of insanity defense\\u003C/a\\u003E within days of the Hinckley verdict, creating the option of “guilty but mentally ill.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s possible that this shift in the burden of proof would have made a dramatic difference to Hinckley’s verdict. Stephen J Morse, professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, says that while he read the trial transcripts he did not attend the trial, and so his opinions are purely speculative, he believes that Hinckley could have lost if he’d been tried in a local rather than federal jurisdiction. In a local jurisdiction at the time, Hinckley’s defense attorneys would have had to show on “a preponderance of the evidence” (i.e. more likely than not) that he was criminally insane—a markedly different burden from the prosecution having to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe system working at its best\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut while the verdict could have so easily gone another way, Hinckley was found not guilty. And, in the years since, has received strong psychiatric support.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStone says that, compared to many other mentally ill criminals in the US who are possible contenders for the insanity defense, Hinckley has received excellent treatment and supervision.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“I think the system rarely works this way but this time, with all the special attention, it worked very well,” he says. “I think it’s amazing that somebody who killed people, maimed people, shot the president of the United States, was able to be restored to sanity, and allowed to leave the hospital, if only partially.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnfortunately, this is not the case for many others. The system of public care for the mentally ill in the US is “in terrible shape,” says Stone, and that there’s little hope of replicating Hinckley’s treatment. “We don’t have the resources, in this wealthy country, to treat anybody else the way we treated Hinckley,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA return to sanity\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFollowing the help he’s received, psychiatric evaluations suggest that Hinckley is no longer suffering from the mental illnesses he experienced 35 years ago. Levine says that others with mental illness who commit criminal acts deserve the same rehabilitation process.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnlike physical health, where it’s widely understood that it’s possible to recover from a broken arm or heart attack, Levine says that many seems to believe a mental disability never fades.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“They think that if you have that, you’re condemned to suffer from it forever, and because you’ve committed a grievous criminal act, it’s likely you’ll do that again,” he says. “That’s just wrong, but that’s the common perception, and that’s why there are so few people who get the benefits that John had.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStone says that he and most other psychiatrists view serious mental illnesses as more akin to diabetes—something that should be treated for life, but can be managed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“If the patient has insight into the fact that they have a mental illness, are willing to take their medications, and work with doctors, then it can be controlled the same way that diabetes can,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough only a psychiatric professional can give a confident assessment of Hinckley’s health, court documents and his time away from hospital suggest that he’s no longer a danger to the public.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMorse, who is not involved in the case, speculates that, were Hinckley an ordinary citizen rather than the man who shot President Reagan, he “might very well have been released before now.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPolitics has undoubtedly shaped this high-profile case, and the judge has been cautious in gradually allowing Hinckley greater freedom. But perhaps, Morse suggests, there will be less pressure to keep Hinckley confined following Nancy Reagan’s death.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, in a country with typically onerous prison sentences, it might seem strange that a man can shoot the president and walk free. But, as Hinckley was found not guilty, Morse points out that he cannot be legally punished.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The judge or public may believe this person should not have been acquitted by reason of insanity, and so they may feel this person should be kept longer,” he says. “But that’s not an adequate justification under law. My concern, both legally and in terms of his mental health, is whether he needed to be hospitalized for as long as he has been.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653671\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T11:11:29-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653671\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/reagan_assassination_attempt_3.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Reagan_assassination_attempt_3\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/reagan_assassination_attempt_3.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653671/35-years-later-the-man-who-shot-president-reagan-is-close-to-being-free/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 15:11:29 UTC +00:00], ["title", "35 years later, the man who shot President Reagan is close to being free"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]

But plenty of other machines are involved in work that has clear ethical implications.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWendell Wallach, a scholar at Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and author of \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Master-Technology-Slipping-Control/dp/0465058620?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003E“A Dangerous Master\\u003C/a\\u003E: How to keep technology from slipping beyond our control,” points out that in hospitals, APACHE medical systems help determine the best treatments for patients in intensive care units—often those who are at the edge of death. Wallach points out that, though the doctor may seem to have autonomy, it could be very difficult in certain situations to go against he machine—particularly in a litigious society. “Is the doctor really free to make an independent decision?,” he says. “You might have a situation where the machine is the de facto decision-maker.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs robots become more advanced, their ethical decision-making will only become more sophisticated. But this raises the question of how to program ethics into robots, and whether we can trust machines with moral decisions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow to build an ethical machine\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBroadly speaking, there are two main approaches to creating an ethical robot. The first is to decide on a specific ethical law (maximize happiness, for example), write a code for such a law, and create a robot that strictly follows the code. But the difficulty here is deciding on the appropriate ethical rule. Every moral law, even the seemingly simple one above, has a myriad of exceptions and counter examples. For example, should a robot maximize happiness by harvesting the organs from one man to save five?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“The issues of morality in general are very vague,” says Ronald Arkin, professor and director of the mobile robot laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology. “We still argue as human beings about the correct moral framework we should use, whether it’s a consequentialist utilitarian means-justify-the-ends approach, or a Kantian deontological rights-based approach.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd this isn’t simply a matter of arguing until we figure out the right answer. Patrick Lin, director of Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, says ethics may not be internally consistent, which would make it impossible to reduce to programs. “The whole system may crash when it encounters paradoxes or unresolvable conflicts,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe second option is to create a machine-learning robot and teach it how to respond to various situations so as to arrive at an ethical outcome. This is similar to how humans learn morality, though it raises the question of whether humans are, in fact, the best moral teachers. If humans like those who interacted with Tay teach a machine-learning robot, then it won’t develop particularly ethical sensibilities.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn some ways, Tay’s ability to absorb what it was being taught is impressive, says Arkin. But he says the bot was “abused by people.” He adds:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou can do that to a simpleton too. In many ways AIs are really simpletons. You can make a fool of somebody, and they choose to make a fool of the AI agent.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EPutting theories into action\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHow to create ethical robots isn’t simply an abstract theory; several philosophers and computer scientists are currently working on just such a feat.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGeorgia Institute of Technology\\u0026#8217;s Arkin is working on trying to make machines comply with international humanitarian law. In this case, there’s a huge body of laws and instructions for machines to follow, which have been developed by humans and agreed by international states. Though some cases are less clear than others, Arkin believes his project will be complete in the next couple of decades.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis work relies a great deal on top-down coding and less so on machine learning—after all, you wouldn’t want to send someone into a military situation and leave them to figure out how to respond.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, Susan Anderson, a philosophy professor at the University of Connecticut, is working with her husband Michael Anderson, a computer science professor at the University of Hartford, to develop robots that can provide ethical care for the elderly. The Andersons’ approach relies far more on machine learning—but, instead of learning from the general public, the machines interact only with ethicists.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESusan Anderson says their work was influenced by philosophers John Rawls and W. D. Ross. While Rawls’ writing on “reflected equilibrium” says that moral principles can be extracted from the ethical decisions made in particular scenarios, Ross makes the case that humans have several prima facie moral duties. We have an obligation to each of these prima facie duties; however, none of them are absolute or automatically override the others. So, in cases where they conflict, they have to be balanced and weighed against each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Andersons work with machine-learning robots to develop principles for elder healthcare. In one case, they created an intelligent system to decide on the ethical course of action when a patient had refused the advised treatment from a healthcare worker. Should the healthcare worker try and convince the patient to accept treatment or not? This involves many complicated ethical duties, including respect for the autonomy of the patient, possible harm to the patient, and possible benefit to the patient.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnderson found that once the robot had been taught a moral response to four specific scenarios, it was then able to generalize and make an appropriate ethical decision in the remaining 14 cases. From this, she was \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://franz.com/success/customer_apps/artificial_intelligence/EthEl/robot-be-good.PDF\\\"\\u003Eable to derive the ethical principle\\u003C/a\\u003E:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“That you should attempt to convince the patient if either the patient is likely to be harmed by not taking the advised treatment or the patient would lose \\u003Cem\\u003Econsiderable\\u003C/em\\u003E benefit. Not just a little benefit, but considerable benefit by not taking the recommended treatment.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough in that early work, the robot was first coded with simple moral duties—such as the importance of preventing harm—the Andersons have since done work where no ethical slant was assumed. Instead, the intelligent system learnt even these moral principles from interacting with ethicists.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EShould we trust robots with morality?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s clearly possible to create robots with some ethical abilities—but should we be pursuing such work? Anderson points out that in some ways, robots can be superior ethical decision-makers to humans.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Humans are a product of natural selection so we have built into us ideas that are self-interested or at least in the interest of our group over others. These are a result of being able to survive as a species,” she says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHumans are also prone to making mistakes, and are not perfect arbiters of justice.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat said, it’s unlikely robots will be able to address the most sophisticated ethical decisions for the foreseeable future. And certainly, while we’re still confused about certain moral sensibilities among humans, it would be unwise to hand the reigns over to robots. As Arkin points out, “Human moral reasoning is not well understood. Nor, in general, is it fully agreed upon.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnderson and the other professors I spoke to agree that machines should not function in areas where there’s moral controversy. And Lin adds that he questions whether it’s ethical, on principle, to offload the hard work of ethical decisions onto machines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“How can a person grow as a person or develop character without using their moral muscle?,” he says. “Imagine if we had an exoskeleton that could make us move, run, life, and do all other physical things better.  Would our lives really be better off if we outsourced physical activity to machines, instead of exercising our own muscles?”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EImproving morality through robots\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut though we may not want to leave the most advanced ethical decisions to machines just yet, work on robotic ethics is advancing our own understanding for morality.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWallach points out that in his book “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Machines-Teaching-Robots-Right/dp/0199737975?tag=quartz07-20\\\"\\u003EMoral Machines\\u003C/a\\u003E: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong,” he argued that just as computers advanced the philosophical understanding of the mind, the same will become true for robots and the study of ethics. The Andersons developing a principle based on their healthcare intelligent system is just one example. Anderson points out that the history of ethics shows a steadily building consensus—and work on robot ethics can contribute to refining moral reasoning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERobot ethics also highlights the elements of ethical decision-making \\u003Cem\\u003Easide\\u003C/em\\u003E from reasoning, says Wallach, such as moral emotions or knowledge of social norms. \\u0026#8220;Because we were talking about whether robots could morally reason, it forced us to look at capabilities humans have that we take for granted and what role they may have in making ethical decisions,” he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt might simply be impossible to reduce human ethical decision making into numerical values for robots to understand, says Lin—how do we codify compassion or mercy, for example. But he says that robot ethics can be seen as a problem of human ethics. \\u0026#8220;Thinking about how robots ought to behave is a soul searching exercise in how humans ought to behave,” he says. “It’s a way for us to know ourselves.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653575\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T09:00:23-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653575\",\"dc_creator\":\"Olivia Goldhill\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtr3gc9i.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RTR3GC9I\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/rtr3gc9i.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653575/can-we-trust-robots-to-make-moral-decisions/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:00:23 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Can we trust robots to make moral decisions?"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]

Instead my fantasies revolved around bylines and books. As I got older, I dedicated much of my energy to getting my writing career off the ground—waking up at 5 am to write fiction before turning to my paying work, and sending submissions to literary journals. My husband and I talked about having a child one day, but in the meantime I concentrated on my career. I didn’t yearn for a baby. I yearned for a book deal, an artist’s retreat, a plum writing gig.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, it’s perfectly possible to be both a mother and a writer. But once women give birth, they’re expected to identify as mothers first and foremost. We’re pressured to move whatever we were before—artist, executive, scientist, ski bum—to the backseat. And so motherhood completely razed the landscape of my identity when I gave birth to my son at age 33.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EParenting in isolation\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“When I see pregnant women, I want to take them by their shoulders and shake.

I knew that raising a baby wouldn’t be easy, but I was unprepared for the overwhelming physical realities of providing constant care for an infant. There is no way to understand the effects of sleep deprivation until you’ve personally spent weeks on end sleeping in three-hour fits. I staggered through the day unshowered, surviving on handfuls of dry cereal. I put off work, sex, and personal hygiene. Suddenly it was clear to me why so many women defined themselves as mothers first. I literally had no time for anything else.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETo make matters worse, our family had recently moved to a new town, two hours away from our deeply-rooted community. Isolation took its toll. My husband was wonderful and supportive, but he worked full-time. I wanted a circle of wise women, elders full of love and patience who could help get me through this without screwing everything up and losing my sanity. But I spent much of those early days with no one but my infant to talk to, the two of us crying in tandem.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENormally I would have turned to writing to process my thoughts and emotions, but now I had no time for it.

I felt redeemed—both in my own eyes and in the eyes of the world. Seeing my name in print offered proof that I wasn’t “just” a mother. That’s a terribly sad statement about how much American culture values motherhood. But let’s face it: many people don’t see parenting as “real” work, and I had firmly internalized that message.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd yet even as our culture dismisses the labor of parenthood, it enforces a deep ambivalence about mothers who dare to pursue careers. A 2013 study by the Pew Research Center shows that Americans are conflicted \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/institutions/Modern%20Parenthood%20%7C%20Pew%20Social%20\\u0026amp;%20Demographic%20Trends.pdf\\\"\\u003Eabout the idea of mothers even returning to work.\\u003C/a\\u003E “Among all adults, only 16% say the ideal situation for a young child is to have a mother who works full time,” the report notes. And so I was convinced that I was horribly selfish for being dedicated to my writing career, yet equally petrified that people would see me only as my son’s mother—never again as a person with hopes and desires of her own.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat finally changed my outlook turned out to be surprisingly simple. At long last, I made friends with other mothers. Together we formed not so much a village as a wailing wall.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EI was convinced that I was selfish for being dedicated to my career, yet petrified that people would see me only as my son’s mother.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003ENow I had women to whom I could admit that I sometimes sort of hated my child—at least when he was throwing a tantrum in the middle of the grocery store. I could sit in their kitchens, half-dead with exhaustion, as they made tea. I could show up at their doors with a cranky toddler and count on being welcomed in and fed. They didn’t judge me for having unkempt hair or wearing my sweater inside out. And many of these mothers had also held strong professional identities before they had children. They were firefighters, lawyers, and teachers, and they were also struggling to figure out how to have a career that was somehow compatible with child-rearing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“We get thrown a lot of ‘do and be whatever you want and lean in,’” Albert tells Quartz, referring to her own experiences with motherhood. “But the realities of childbearing are not compatible with that.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI finally understood that almost all mothers struggle to find the right balance between family and career once I had this circle of friends. And I also had a bigger epiphany: We aren’t meant to parent in isolation.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EA circle of women\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMost of us aren’t going to rush out and form communes anytime soon. But it’s undoubtedly true that mothers need to seen, heard, and helped by others who have had the same experiences and know what it’s like to be in the trenches. Once I found my community, I found that the energy I’d spent obsessing over parenting and self-loathing was suddenly freed up. Only then was I truly able to feel like myself again.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPsychologists have reached the same conclusions. “In terms of perinatal mood disorders, social support is one of the legs that holds a mom up,” Katayune Kaeni, a California-based maternal mental health specialist and psychologist tells Quartz. “Just not feeling alone helps.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“For the women I see, to feel that ‘I’m not crazy, this is a thing and it happens, that’s incredibly relieving,” Kaeni continues.

In the rawness of literature, women tell the unvarnished, necessary truths about raising children. “Women have always been the storytellers.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, I count novels like Albert’s, and memoirs like Rachel Cusk’s \\u003Cem\\u003EA Life’s Work\\u003C/em\\u003E, among my circle of women. My friends have helped to ground me so that I can tackle both writing and mothering. In the same way, stories of rough entrées into motherhood offer me companionship. What\\u0026#8217;s more, books that tell women’s messy, emotionally complex stories remind me of why I write in the first place.

The majority of shortages tend to be critical care drugs, cancer medications, and antibiotics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ENationwide, shortages of critical drugs are not particularly new or rare. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EEfforts like a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gphaonline.org/issues/drug-shortages\\\"\\u003E“Drug Shortage Summit”\\u003C/a\\u003E held by physician and pharmacist groups in November of 2010 may have helped in the short-term, but they failed to attack the root of the problem. And while the FDA says shortages have declined, the picture painted by other organizations are less rosy. According to the University of Utah’s Drug Information Service, for example, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-drug-shortages-frustrate-doctors-patients-1433125793\\\"\\u003Ein May of 2015 there were around 250 drugs\\u003C/a\\u003E in short supply across the US.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, on any given day you can go to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists website and check out its \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ashp.org/drugshortages/current/\\\"\\u003Ecurrent list of shortages\\u003C/a\\u003E. The website proclaims proudly that they “work to keep the public informed of the most current drug shortages.” But is awareness enough? As of March, I counted 153 medications on the APH list, ranging from antibiotics to vaccines, cardiac medications, and cancer drugs. Even saline, a simple mix of salt and water used for hydration and resuscitation, made the list. In 2014, similar shortages of saline\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/06/22/323679204/shortage-of-saline-solution-has-hospitals-on-edge\\\"\\u003E forced hospitals to develop special protocols\\u003C/a\\u003E designed to conserve IV fluids.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo how is it that one of the richest nations in the world could possibly have a shortage of salt water—or any of these generic drugs?

In order to create a sort of emergency pipeline, the generic pharmaceutical industry has started what it calls the “Accelerated Recovery Initiative (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gphaonline.org/issues/drug-shortages\\\"\\u003EARI\\u003C/a\\u003E),” the goal of which is to limit the number of patients who cannot get a hold of drugs in critical shortage. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.policymed.com/2012/09/ftc-approves-accelerated-recovery-initiative-to-reduce-drug-shortages.html\\\"\\u003EWhile the process is long\\u003C/a\\u003E and complicated, it proves this is not an entirely unsolvable issue.

Among its provisions, the bill would provide expedited review of new generic drug applications “only if there’s one competing generic on the market or if the generic is on FDA’s drug shortage list.” Collins’ actions represent yet another step forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEnding the generic shortage will not be easy, but then again, neither is curing cancer. If we can embark on a moonshot to find novel therapies that will cost thousands of dollars a dose, why can’t we find ways to ensure that the generic drugs we’ve been making for pennies a vial can actually make it to the hands of our patients? We need to permanently fix this problem rather than putting on another bandaid—we never seem to have a shortage of those.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=653136\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2016-04-03T07:30:46-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/653136\",\"dc_creator\":\"Dr. Anees Chagpar\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ap763297742944.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Cancer Chemotherapy\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ap763297742944.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/653136/americas-ongoing-lack-of-generic-drugs-is-a-matter-of-life-and-death/"], ["published_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 11:30:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "America&#8217;s ongoing lack of generic drugs is a matter of life and death"], ["updated_at", Sun, 03 Apr 2016 21:14:20 UTC +00:00]]
